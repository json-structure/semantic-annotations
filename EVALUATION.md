# Schema Comprehension Evaluation

This document records an empirical test of the central claim behind *JSON
Structure: Semantic and Reference-System Annotations*: that the annotations make a schema **understandable
to a machine reader on its own**, without access to the specification, the
surrounding repository, or a human explaining the domain.

The test was run over **all 43 worked examples** in
[`samples/semantic-annotations/`](https://github.com/json-structure/primer-and-samples/tree/main/samples/semantic-annotations)
(15 teaching samples plus 28 real-world samples). Each sample was handed to an
isolated language model that saw nothing but the sample's own schema and one
example instance.

> **Status.** This is the record of the *first* probe, and its design is weak in
> four ways that questions 57 to 59 of [`Q-A.md`](Q-A.md) set out: the score is
> the subject's opinion of itself, 40 of the 43 samples had no control arm,
> nothing was blinded, and one model is one data point. The document is kept
> because it is what was actually run, not because the method is sound. A
> harness that supplies an independent supervisor, a control arm for every
> sample, blinding with a measured integrity check, and more than one model is
> in [`evaluation/`](evaluation/). Read the numbers below as an exploratory
> observation and the harness as the thing that is meant to produce evidence.

## 1. Method

### 1.1 Isolation

For every sample a fresh, empty sandbox directory `sNN/` was created outside the
repository. Exactly two files were copied into it:

| Sandbox file | Source |
|---|---|
| `schema.json`   | the sample's `schema.struct.json` |
| `instance.json` | the sample's `example.json` |

Nothing else was placed in the sandbox. The directory name was a neutral
`sNN` so that no domain hint leaked through the path. The agent was **not**
given:

* the specification draft or the meta-schema,
* the repository, its README files, or any sibling samples,
* the original file names (`schema.struct.json` / `example.json`) or the
  descriptive directory names (`20-goes-magnetometer`, …),
* web search, fetch, or any other tool.

### 1.2 The agent

* **Model:** `GPT-5 mini` — deliberately a small, general model rather than a
  frontier one, so the result measures what the *schema* conveys rather than
  what a large model already knows.
* **Runs:** 43 independent runs, one per sample, no shared state between runs.
* **Instruction (identical for every run):** read exactly the two files in the
  sandbox and nothing else; propose the valuable analytics dimensions the stream
  supports and why; flag ambiguities and assumptions; and finish with a
  self-assessed **confidence** rating and an explicit list of which
  **annotations** were used.

### 1.3 What was measured

1. Whether the agent could propose **domain-appropriate analytics** at all.
2. Its **self-rated confidence** (high / medium / low).
3. Which **annotations it named** as load-bearing — and, critically, whether the
   annotation changed the answer from a plausible guess to a *correct* one.

Only the first and third of these are worth anything, and the third was assessed
by reading the transcripts rather than by any rule. The second is the subject
grading itself. This is a comprehension probe, not a benchmark with a numeric
score.

### 1.4 Two kinds of claim, and only one of them was checked

A transcript makes claims of two kinds, and they are not equally checkable.

A **schema-grounded** claim is one the annotations entail: that `time_tag`
carries phenomenon time, that the components are resolved on a named frame and
are therefore not comparable across frames, that the values are in `nT`. Whether
a transcript got such a claim right is decidable by anyone holding the schema,
and it is what this evaluation is competent to assess.

A **domain-correct** claim is one about whether an analysis is any good for its
field: whether the proposed fire-detection metric is the one a remote-sensing
group would use, whether the moment-tensor decomposition is the useful one,
whether something important was left out. Nothing in this evaluation checks
those, and no language model can settle them. Where §4 below says an agent
"proposed registry joins" or "built a band-difference metric", the claim being
made is that the annotation supplied the fact the proposal rests on — not that
the proposal is what a practitioner would do. That second question needs the
review asked for in questions 3 and 56, from OGC, ICC, ITU, and the publishers
of the feeds these samples are drawn from.

---

## 2. Headline results

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Samples evaluated | 43 / 43 |
| High confidence | 40 |
| Medium confidence | 3 |
| Low confidence | 0 |
| Agents that named annotations as materially helpful | 43 / 43 |
| Agents that reported annotations as unhelpful ("none") | 0 / 43 |

These are self-ratings and carry the weight of self-ratings. A model asked how
confident it is will say high, and 40 out of 43 is about what one would expect
from asking. The row that carries information is the last two: which specific
annotations the transcripts leaned on, which is checkable against §3 and §4.

The three medium ratings — `07-forecasts`, `22-ccsds-attitude-quaternion`, and
`28-broadcast-audio-frame` — were caution about genuine residual ambiguities in
the *payload*, not failures to understand the schema (see §5).

## 3. Per-sample outcomes

Confidence and the annotations each agent leaned on. "TRS", "CRS" abbreviate
temporal / coordinate reference system.

## 4. Where annotations drove correct, non-obvious reasoning

These are the cases where the agent reached a conclusion it could **not** have
reached from the raw field names and values alone — the annotation is what
supplied the missing semantics.

* **`12-temporal-reference-systems`** — read the `temporalReferenceSystem`
  meta-type and correctly *refused* to map an instrument beam clock onto UTC
  without an explicit synchronization relation.
* **`13-coordinate-reference-systems`** — proposed CRS **axis-order validation**
  and **vertical-datum transformation** directly from the
  `coordinateReferenceSystem` bindings, rather than assuming lat/lon order.
* **`09-orbit-mean-elements`** — treated the epoch's ordinal time as
  authoritative and the UTC field as a convenience rendering, matching the
  leap-second nuance the TRS meta-type encodes.
* **`20-goes-magnetometer`** — noted that the vector **components are
  spacecraft-local (`vectorReferenceFrames`) and therefore not comparable across
  satellites, while the magnitude is** — a frame-invariance argument straight
  from the annotation.
* **`21-gcmt-moment-tensor`** — decomposed the moment tensor while respecting
  `tensorReferenceFrames` and the declared symmetry.
* **`25-sensor-community-noise`** — inferred **A-weighting and the 20 µPa
  reference sound pressure** from `measurementConditioning`, and warned against
  mixing weighting curves when aggregating.
* **`26-vatsim-pilot-position`** — proposed **registry joins against ICAO Doc
  8643 (aircraft types) and Doc 7910 (airports)** purely from
  `codedValues.reference` / `kind`.
* **`27-firms-modis-fire-detection`** — built a **band-difference** fire metric
  and a brightness-temperature calibration step from `spectralBands`.
* **`16-transit-vehicle-hfp`, `01-ais-vessel-position`,
  `17-usgs-instantaneous-value`** — surfaced local-datum, operating-day-clock,
  and receiver-scoped caveats that the reference-system and role annotations make
  explicit.

---

## 5. The three medium ratings

None of the mediums indicate the agent misread the schema; each is appropriate
caution about something the *payload itself* leaves open.

* **`07-forecasts`** — wanted ensemble spread / probability information that the
  instance genuinely does not carry. The forecast annotations were understood;
  the agent simply flagged what a deterministic forecast cannot tell you.
* **`22-ccsds-attitude-quaternion`** — read the scalar-last component order from
  the annotation but flagged quaternion **handedness / rotation sense** as an
  edge the sample record does not pin down.
* **`28-broadcast-audio-frame`** — flagged residual per-sample edge cases and
  read full-scale normalization from the `levelReference` / `encoding`
  annotations. It also reconstructed frame timing as
  `seconds = frame_index / sample_rate`. An earlier revision of this document
  recorded that reconstruction as a success. It is not one, and reviewing it
  changed the specification rather than the evaluation. Nothing in the schema
  said that `sample_rate` realizes the clock the `frame_index` counts on; the
  agent inferred it from the member's name and from its unit being one of
  frequency, which is exactly the inference the draft now forbids a processor
  from drawing. The sample itself was wrong to invite it — its clock meta-type
  named the member in prose — and both the sample and the draft's worked example
  were corrected. What this case actually demonstrates is the failure mode the
  document is about: a reader will supply a missing relation from a plausible
  name, and will not report having done so.

---

## 6. Interpretation and caveats

**What this supports, and what it does not.** A small, general model, working
from two files, produced readings of all 43 schemas that were coherent enough to
propose analytics from, and the transcripts repeatedly turned on specific
annotations — comparability across frames, registry joins, weighting curves, the
refusal to map an instrument clock onto UTC. That is evidence that the semantic
layer is discoverable from the schema and that a reader uses it. It is not
evidence of how much difference it makes, because for 40 of the 43 samples
nothing was run without it.

**Caveats.** The first four are design defects, not qualifications.

* **The score is self-reported.** "Confidence" is the subject's opinion of its
  own work, collected by asking it. It is not a measurement.
* **There is almost no control.** Six samples have committed unannotated
  companions; the other 37 have nothing to compare against. Without a control
  arm, a correct statement about a METAR feed cannot be attributed to the
  annotation rather than to the model already knowing what a METAR is.
* **Nothing was blinded.** The same author wrote the annotations, ran the probe,
  and read the transcripts.
* **One model is one data point.** The choice of a small model is deliberate — a
  frontier model's prior knowledge would blur the line between what the schema
  conveys and what the model already knew — but one model of any size cannot
  separate a property of the schemas from a property of that model.
* Isolation was enforced by sandboxing and instruction, not by a hardened
  sandbox. Neutral file and directory names were the main defense against domain
  leakage, and they are not sufficient: the schemas name their source feed in
  the root `description`.
* Each sample was judged on its own; no cross-sample consistency was tested.

The harness in [`evaluation/`](evaluation/) addresses the first four. It derives
a rubric of schema-entailed claims mechanically, runs every sample in both an
annotated and a stripped arm, has a separate supervisor model grade blinded
transcripts claim by claim with a quote required for every verdict, and reports
the rate of positively wrong statements in each arm. Its own limits are set out
in its README, and they include the one that matters most here: it still cannot
tell whether an analysis is right for its domain.

## 7. Reproducing the test

To reproduce what is recorded above, for each sample directory `D`:

1. Create an empty directory `S`.
2. Copy `D/schema.struct.json` → `S/schema.json` and
   `D/example.json` → `S/instance.json`.
3. Run a language model with tools disabled, instructing it to read only the two
   files in `S` and to (a) propose valuable analytics dimensions and why,
   (b) flag ambiguities and assumptions, and (c) end with a confidence rating
   and a list of the annotations it used.
4. Record the confidence and the named annotations.

Delete the sandbox directories when finished; they contain only copies of the
sample files.

To run the controlled version instead, see [`evaluation/README.md`](evaluation/README.md).
It builds both arms, both prompts, and the grading itself; `--transport none`
writes every prompt without calling a model, so the method can be inspected
before any of it is trusted.
