--- abstract

Data types describe representation, but they do not explain the semantic,
temporal, spatial, and operational characteristics needed to interpret and
compare data. This document defines optional JSON Structure annotations that
bind schema nodes to terms in external vocabularies; annotations for
observation results, observed properties, features of interest, procedures,
time semantics, quality, derivation, and cadence; annotations for spatial
referencing by coordinates, by vector and tensor reference frames, by
transformations between frames, and along linear elements; and annotations for
color spaces, audio channel layouts, spectral bands, code lists, and
measurement conditioning.

The annotations make an incompatibility between two data sets detectable by
machine; they do not resolve one. This document defines no conversion, and a
processor that cannot resolve a referenced definition reports the check as
indeterminate rather than assuming agreement. Correctly declining to combine
two values is the outcome these annotations enable; transforming them so that
they can be combined remains the work of a tool that holds the authoritative
definitions.

The annotations provide progressively richer evidence. Their absence does not
make a schema invalid, and the annotations do not define analytical procedures,
expressions, causal inference, execution policy, or a lineage model. Several of
them carry lineage facts; none of them chains one value to another, and a schema
needing lineage in the modeled sense uses a provenance model beside them.

# Introduction {#introduction}

A schema states how a value is written. It gives a type, and with JSON Structure
Units {{JSTRUCT-UNITS}} it gives a unit, so that a reader knows a member holds a
number of metres. It does not state what the number measures, what the metres
are measured from, or when the measurement applies. Two schemas can agree on
`double` and on `m` and still describe water level above a tide-gauge datum and
height above an ellipsoid, which are not the same quantity and must not be
compared. That difference is usually recorded in prose documentation, inferred
from a member name, or known only to the people who built the system.

This document is an extension to JSON Structure Core {{JSTRUCT-CORE}} that
records it in the schema, by annotation, without changing what the schema
validates. Its keywords let a schema author:

- bind a type or member to a term in a published vocabulary, so that two systems
  naming a thing differently can establish that they mean the same thing;
- declare what a record observes and which member carries the result, as
  distinct from the property observed, the feature it belongs to, the procedure
  that produced it, and the time it applies to;
- name the reference system a value is expressed against, whether a temporal
  regime, a coordinate reference system, a vector or tensor reference frame, a
  transformation from one frame to another, or a linear reference system, so
  that a position, a direction, or an orientation can be interpreted and two of
  them compared; and
- resolve the members that together carry one compound value onto the axes,
  channels, or bands that give them meaning, whether those of a color space, an
  audio channel layout, or a set of spectral bands.

The same concern applies to a value that stands alone. One keyword binds a
coded value to the register that assigns the code its meaning, so that a number
or a short string can be resolved rather than guessed at from a member name.
Another records the frequency weighting, time weighting, and level reference
that a conditioned measurement already carries, so that a sound level measured
under one weighting is not silently compared with one measured under another.

Most of these are bindings to a definition maintained elsewhere. This document
defines no vocabulary, no reference system, no color space, no channel layout,
and no code list of its own. Established bodies
publish them, and an annotation refers to one. What is
defined here is the form of that reference, the roles a schema may assign to its
own members, and the rules by which a processor can check that the two agree.

The roles are the one place where that account needs qualifying. `semanticRole`
and `derivation` do carry a vocabulary of observation concepts, and this document
does not pretend otherwise. What it declines to be is a normative encoding of the
observation model of {{ISO19156}}. It defines no observation as a type to
instantiate, no classes for procedures or features, and no relationships among
observation entities, and it requires no record to be shaped like an observation.
The roles describe what the members of a record already are, over a structure
someone else fixed. A record does not become an observation by carrying them, a
schema that carries none is not deficient for that reason, and a processor MUST
NOT reconstruct an observation entity from the roles it finds.

Nor does this document define analytical procedures. Several keywords name an
operation, and naming one is not specifying it. A schema that declares a value
an hourly mean records an operation that has already been performed; it does not
state what a mean computes, how gaps in the set were treated, whether the window
was inclusive of its bounds, or whether a consumer may recompute the value. The
annotations describe what was done, and a processor MUST NOT read an instruction
out of them.

Nor does it define a lineage model, although several keywords carry lineage
facts: `derivation` says how a value was produced, `observingProcedure`
identifies what produced it, and `ingestionTime` says when a system received it.
{{PROV-O}} gives entities, activities, and agents identities and relates them by
derivation and attribution. What is here is flat and confined to one record,
with no identity for the act that produced a value and no way to chain a value
to the value it came from. The two do not conflict and a record can carry both;
the `concepts` example maps a publication instant onto `prov:generatedAtTime`
({{concepts}}).

The keywords defined here are chosen by one test. A quality of a value earns a
keyword when a consumer must know it to decide whether two values may be
combined or compared, and when it holds for the type rather than varying from
one instance to the next. Axis order, frequency weighting, and the register a
code is drawn from meet that test: get one of them wrong and an arithmetic
result is wrong while every value still validates. Licensing, retention, and
endpoint addressing do not meet it, because they do not change what may be
computed from a value. A per-observation calibration record does not meet it,
because it varies from one record to the next and belongs in the payload rather
than in the schema. Geometry, provenance, and unit algebra do not meet it,
because each is a model in its own right that another specification defines;
this document cites those rather than restating them.

The annotations are optional and additive. A processor that does not implement
them reads the schema exactly as JSON Structure Core defines it.

## Semantic Binding and External Definitions {#semantic-binding}

Most keywords defined here share one shape. Each is an object carrying a
`reference` property that identifies a definition and a `kind` property that
names the model the definition belongs to. This lets a reader know how to
interpret it and a processor know what can be checked.
`concepts`, `observedProperty`, `temporalReferenceSystem`,
`coordinateReferenceSystem`, `linearReferenceSystem`, `codedValues`, the entries
of `vectorReferenceFrames`, `colorSpaces`, `audioChannels`, and
`spectralBands`, and the frames named by `tensorReferenceFrames` and
`frameTransforms` all follow this shape.

A definition is ordinarily maintained outside the schema, and `reference` is
then an absolute URI {{RFC3986}}. Every one of these keywords except `concepts`
and `observedProperty` also admits a definition held in the schema itself,
carried by a shareable type that
{{meta-types}} calls a meta-type; `kind` is then `type` and `reference` is a
type reference `{ "$ref": <JSON Pointer> }` to that type. The `kind` determines
which form applies, and each keyword states the rule for its own values.

A `kind` names a definition model and not the format of the resource that
carries it. The enumerations are open so that an author whose model is not
already named can name it.

The annotations bind terms; they do not express statements, node identity, or
entailment, and this document defines no prefix mechanism and no compact URI
form.

A value is read against one temporal or coordinate reference system, quantifies
one phenomenon, and draws its code from one register, so those keywords,
`observedProperty`, and `codedValues` each take a single binding. Vocabularies
overlap by design, and the same notion is
deliberately given a term in several of them, so `concepts` takes a list. The
keywords that resolve components onto axes, channels, or bands take a list for a
different reason: one record can carry several such quantities at once, and one
set of numbers can be published in more than one frame or more than one color
space at once.

`measurementConditioning` stands apart from this shape. It identifies no
external definition, because what it records is not a system a value is read
against but a treatment the value has already undergone, and it states that
treatment directly.

## Observable and Observed Property Concepts {#observable-observed-concepts}

Observation is one application of the general model in {{semantic-binding}}. An
*observable property definition* is the externally governed concept, such as
water level or bridge vibration, and this document defines no format for one.
An *observed property declaration* is the `observedProperty` annotation that
binds one record shape to one such definition.

An observation act is one concrete execution of an observing procedure for one
declared observed property and feature context, producing one result value and
optionally its qualifiers.

# Conventions {#conventions}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Annotation Model {#annotation-model}

`concepts` MAY occur on a type definition and on a property, collection item,
map value, or choice member schema, subject to {{vocabulary-annotations}}.

`semanticRole`, `derivation`, `temporalReferenceSystem`, and `cadence` MAY occur
directly on a property, collection item, map value, or choice member schema,
subject to {{observation-annotations}}. `phenomenonTimeRelation` and
`supportPeriod` MAY occur on a direct property. `statistic` MAY occur wherever
`derivation` occurs, subject to {{statistic}}. `temporalReferenceSystem` MAY
also occur on an object or tuple that defines a temporal type, and binds an
existing member of it.

`observedProperty` MAY occur on an object or tuple intended to describe an
observation record, and on a member schema of one that carries a result,
subject to {{observed-property}}.
`coordinateReferenceSystem`, `vectorReferenceFrames`, `tensorReferenceFrames`,
`frameTransforms`, `linearReferenceSystem`, `colorSpaces`, `audioChannels`, and
`spectralBands` MAY occur on an object or tuple and bind existing properties.
`codedValues` and `measurementConditioning` MAY occur on a property, collection
item, map value, or choice member schema, subject to their sections.
`referenceRole` MAY occur on a member of a meta-type, subject to {{meta-types}}.

All keywords defined here are direct peer keywords, and no wrapper is implied.
Every annotation is OPTIONAL, and a schema can use any subset, including none.
Conformance constrains only annotations that are present; it never requires
another annotation or an annotated property to exist.

Several keywords bind members of the annotated type by name. Such a name is the
name of the property as declared in the schema, and it is resolved against the
effective definition of the annotated type, which includes members contributed
by `$extends` and members of an imported or shadowing definition
{{JSTRUCT-IMPORT}}. A name that does not resolve to a direct member of that
effective definition is invalid. An alternate, localized, or otherwise
serialization-facing name assigned to a member by another extension, such as
JSON Structure Alternate Names {{JSTRUCT-ALTNAMES}}, changes how the member
appears in an instance document and does not change the identity the annotation
binds; a processor MUST NOT resolve a member name stated in an annotation
against such a name, and MUST NOT treat the presence of one as altering the
mapping.

Every `reference` value that is a URI SHOULD be resolvable, and dereferencing it
SHOULD yield a definition of the identified term or system. A processor is not
required to dereference a `reference`, and an unresolved `reference` is
indeterminate rather than incorrect.

A `reference` identifies whatever its URI identifies, revision included, and
this document defines no version, epoch, or as-of member to stand beside it. A
body that revises definitions and means them to stay citable puts the revision
in the identifier, which is what the naming policy behind the identifiers used
throughout this document provides for: a definition is named
`/def/{objectType}/{authority}/{version}/{code}` {{OGC-NAMES}}, so the `0` in
`http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326` occupies a version position that a
schema needing one edition rather than another fills in. A schema pins an
edition by writing the identifier the publisher supplies for it.

A separate member would state in a second place what the URI already carries,
and no processor could reconcile the two without resolving the reference, which
none is required to do. Where a publisher revises without giving each revision
an identifier, a schema SHOULD record that fact in `description`, which informs
a reader without inviting a processor to act on it.

The enumerations of this document are of two sorts, and one rule divides them.
An enumeration is closed where its values select a behavior that this document
itself defines, so that a value outside it would establish nothing for any
processor. An enumeration is open where its values name a model, register, or
definition that another body maintains, because this document cannot enumerate
what others publish and a value it has not heard of may still be one that a
reader knows.

Closed are `semanticRole`, `derivation`, `statistic` in both of its forms,
`phenomenonTimeRelation`, `referenceRole`, `sortOrder`, the `kind` of `cadence`,
the `anchor` of `supportPeriod`,
the `variance` of `vectorReferenceFrames` and `tensorReferenceFrames`, the
`symmetry` of `tensorReferenceFrames`, the `encoding` and `rotationSequence` of
`frameTransforms`, and the `alphaMode` and `transfer` of `colorSpaces`. A value
outside a closed enumeration is invalid.

Open are the `kind` of every reference-style keyword, the `weighting` and
`timeWeighting` of `measurementConditioning`, the `levelReference` of both
`measurementConditioning` and `audioChannels`, the `calibration` of
`spectralBands`, and the `encoding` of `audioChannels`. A value
outside an open enumeration is valid; a processor MUST preserve it and MUST NOT
reject a schema for carrying it.

Closure states where a value's meaning comes from, and is not a claim that a
list is finished. A later version of this document may add values to a closed
enumeration, and the versioned meta-schema URI a schema names is what tells a
processor which set is in force ({{extension-meta-schema}}).

A value defined here is one a processor can act on, and this document states
what each establishes. A value
not defined here establishes nothing, and a processor MUST NOT infer a
constraint from it. This document defines no registry of further values and no
mechanism by which a private value acquires meaning for a processor that does
not already know it.

Because the open enumerations are open, two authors may choose one token for two
unrelated things. `kind` classifies and `reference` identifies, and that
division bounds the consequence. A processor MUST NOT treat a `kind` value as
establishing the identity of a definition, and MUST NOT conclude from two
schemas carrying equal `kind` values that they draw on the same register, model,
or definition. Where `kind` agrees and `reference` does not, the references
govern. A processor meeting a `kind` it does not recognize reports the check
indeterminate ({{check-outcomes}}).

That bounds a collision rather than preventing one. A registry of `kind` values
is the remedy; a future revision of this document is expected to establish one,
and none exists at the time of writing. Until one does, a `kind` value outside
those defined here means what it means only to a processor that already knows
it. A schema SHOULD use a value defined here where one fits, and SHOULD NOT coin
a broad token such as `sensor` or `registry` for a private arrangement, since
the broadest tokens are the ones most likely to be coined twice.

| Keyword | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `concepts` | Terms in external vocabularies that the annotated node corresponds to. |

| `spectralBands` | Spectral bands and ordered properties forming the bands of a multiband value. |
| `codedValues` | Binding from a coded property to an external code list. |

Omission means undeclared unless stated otherwise. It never implies compatible,
successful, or acceptable data.

# Vocabulary Annotations {#vocabulary-annotations}

## The `concepts` Keyword {#concepts}

The `concepts` keyword binds the annotated node to terms defined by external
vocabularies, following the model in {{semantic-binding}}. In this document a
concept is any term that a vocabulary defines, including a class, a property, or
a SKOS concept {{SKOS}}. The `skos-concept` kind names one such term type and
places no constraint on the others.

When present, `concepts` MUST be a non-empty array of objects. Each object MUST
have a REQUIRED `reference` string and a REQUIRED `kind` string. No other
properties are permitted.

The array is unordered and no entry is primary. Every entry holds
simultaneously: the annotated node corresponds to all of the terms listed, and a
reader does not select among them. Two entries MUST NOT carry the same
`reference`.

### The `reference` Property {#concepts-reference}

`reference` MUST be an absolute URI {{RFC3986}} that identifies one term. The
URI is the identifier that the vocabulary assigns to the term. This document
defines no prefix mechanism, no compact form, and no resolution protocol.

### The `kind` Property {#concepts-kind}

`kind` classifies which definition model the URI identifies. It is an open
enumeration. The following values are defined:

| Value | Referenced definition |
|---|---|
| `rdfs-class` | A class in RDF Schema {{RDF-SCHEMA}}. |
| `rdf-property` | An RDF property {{RDF-CONCEPTS}}. |
| `owl-class` | A class in OWL 2 {{OWL2}}. |
| `owl-object-property` | An OWL 2 object property. |
| `owl-datatype-property` | An OWL 2 datatype property. |
| `skos-concept` | A concept in a SKOS concept scheme {{SKOS}}. |
| `dcterms-property` | A property in DCMI Metadata Terms {{DCTERMS}}. |

Other values MAY identify further definition models. {{vocabulary-uris}} lists
namespace URIs for the vocabularies named above.

### Type Compatibility {#concept-type-compatibility}

A `kind` denotes either a class or a property, and the two attach to different
schema nodes:

* `rdfs-class` and `owl-class` denote a class, and the annotation MUST occur on
  a type definition.
* `rdf-property`, `owl-object-property`, `owl-datatype-property`, and
  `dcterms-property` denote a property, and the annotation MUST occur on a
  property, collection item, map value, or choice member schema.
* `skos-concept` denotes neither, and the annotation MAY occur on either.

All entries of one `concepts` array MUST agree. An array MUST NOT combine an
entry whose `kind` denotes a class with an entry whose `kind` denotes a
property. A `kind` outside the values defined above establishes no constraint,
and a processor MUST NOT infer one.

### Relationship to the Annotation Model {#concepts-redundancy}

The keywords defined in this document already state the part a node plays. A
`concepts` entry that names a term whose meaning is that same part carries no
information beyond the annotation it accompanies and SHOULD be omitted.

A node that carries `observedProperty` is an observation record by
{{annotation-model}}, and SHOULD NOT also be bound to a general observation
class. A member that carries `semanticRole` SHOULD NOT also be bound to a
vocabulary property whose meaning is that same role, such as a term for the
result of an observation beside `observationValue`, or a term for the feature
that an observation is about beside `featureOfInterest`.

`concepts` is for meaning that the annotation model does not carry: the domain
class of a record, the catalogue or taxonomic term that a member names, or a
correspondence that a consumer needs in order to join the data to another
vocabulary. A redundant entry is not an error, and a processor MUST NOT reject a
document for carrying one.

### Relationship to `observedProperty` {#concepts-and-observed-property}

`concepts` states which external terms the annotated node corresponds to.
`observedProperty` states which phenomenon a record quantifies. Where the term
is an observable-property definition, `observedProperty` carries it and
`concepts` MUST NOT name it. The same URI MUST NOT appear in both keywords on
one node.

Correspondences between one observable-property definition and terms in other
vocabularies belong to the definition and are recorded once there, as described
in {{observable-property-mappings}}. They are not repeated as `concepts` entries
in every schema that cites the definition.

A binding is a statement about meaning and not about resolution. A missing or
unresolved term is indeterminate and MUST NOT be repaired from property names,
descriptions, labels, or samples.

Example:

~~~ json
{
  "name": "TideGaugeReading",
  "type": "object",
  "description": "One water-level reading from a coastal tide gauge.",
  "concepts": [
    {
      "reference": "http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Observation",
      "kind": "owl-class"
    }
  ],

        {
          "reference": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/issued",
          "kind": "dcterms-property"
        },
        {

      ]
    }
  }
}
~~~

# Observation Annotations {#observation-annotations}

## The `observedProperty` Keyword {#observed-property}

The `observedProperty` keyword identifies the observable-property definition
associated with an observation record, or with one result within it, as
introduced in {{observable-observed-concepts}}.

When present, `observedProperty` MUST be an object with a REQUIRED `reference`
string and a REQUIRED `kind` string. No other properties are permitted.

### The `reference` Property {#observed-property-reference}

`reference` MUST be an absolute URI {{RFC3986}} that identifies one immutable
observable-property definition. Version identity, when used, is implied by the
URI itself, and a materially different concept MUST be identified by a
different URI. The URI SHOULD deep-link to one concrete definition entry in the
selected vocabulary. This document does not define a resolution protocol, URI
layout, storage model, or catalog serialization.

### The `kind` Property {#observed-property-kind}

`kind` classifies which definition model the URI identifies. It is an open
enumeration, and a value identifies the vocabulary or catalog type that
publishes the definition.

Examples of catalog types include:

* `cf-standard-name` for URIs identifying entries from the CF Standard Name
  Table, for example a URI identifying `air_temperature`;
* `nerc-p01` for entries from the NERC Vocabulary Server Parameter Usage
  Vocabulary (P01) identified by dereferenceable concept URIs.

An organization that publishes its own catalog names its own model. The examples
in this document use `example-catalog` where the cited catalog is fictional.

Example:

~~~ json
{
  "observedProperty": {
    "reference": "https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/CTMPZZ01/",
    "kind": "nerc-p01"
  }
}
~~~

### Attachment and Scope {#observed-property-attachment-and-scope}

`observedProperty` MAY occur on an object or tuple that describes an observation
record, and on a member schema of that object or tuple that carries a result.

On a record it identifies the observable property of every result in that record
that does not carry one of its own. On a result member it identifies the
observable property of that result alone and takes precedence over the record's.

Every annotation identifies exactly one observable property for the node it is
attached to. A missing or unresolved reference is indeterminate and MUST NOT be
repaired from labels, mappings, result schemas, units, descriptions, property
names, or samples.

The feature, procedure, and temporal roles of a record are shared by every
result in it. Where a record carries more than one result, a `resultQuality` on
the record qualifies all of them, and qualifying one result on its own requires
modelling that result as a nested object.

Example of a record with two results:

~~~ json
{
  "name": "BuoySurfacePacket",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "buoy_id": {
      "type": "string",
      "semanticRole": "featureOfInterest"
    },
    "measured_at": {
      "type": "datetime",
      "description": "Time both results occurred",
      "examples": ["2026-07-27T12:00:00Z"],
      "semanticRole": "phenomenonTime"
    },
    "sea_surface_temperature": {
      "type": "double",
      "unit": "Cel",
      "examples": [18.4],
      "semanticRole": "observationValue",
      "observedProperty": {
        "reference": "https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/CTMPZZ01/",
        "kind": "nerc-p01"
      }
    },
    "practical_salinity": {
      "type": "double",
      "unit": "1",
      "examples": [35.1],
      "semanticRole": "observationValue",
      "observedProperty": {
        "reference": "https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/P01/current/PSLTZZ01/",
        "kind": "nerc-p01"
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["buoy_id", "measured_at", "sea_surface_temperature", "practical_salinity"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
~~~

## Semantic Mappings and Result Hints {#observable-property-mappings}

An authority MAY publish semantic mappings from an observable-property
definition to other identified concepts, using relation kinds such as
`exactMatch`, `closeMatch`, `broader`, `narrower`, `related`, and
`quantityKind`. Mapping targets MUST be absolute URIs, and a mapping SHOULD
carry a review state such as `proposed`, `reviewed`, or `rejected`.

Only a reviewed `exactMatch` can provide evidence that two distinct identifiers
denote the same observable property. `closeMatch`, hierarchy, relatedness,
label similarity, and quantity-kind classification do not establish
equivalence, and no mapping alone authorizes execution.

A `quantityKind` mapping can reference a QUDT QuantityKind {{QUDT}} as a
classification and compatibility hint. Other mappings can target CF Standard
Names, SOSA/SSN concepts, or agency vocabularies
{{CF-STANDARD-NAMES}} {{SOSA-SSN}}.

An authority MAY identify an expected result schema. That schema and any
quantity-kind mapping are hints; the actual result schema and JSON Structure
Units annotations remain authoritative. An observable-property definition MUST
NOT override unit semantics or duplicate authoritative dimensions, unit lists,
conversion factors, or conversion formulas.

## The `semanticRole` Keyword {#semantic-role}

The `semanticRole` keyword identifies the observation or operational function of an
annotated value.

The value of `semanticRole` MUST be one of a closed set of permitted values
defined in this section. A `semanticRole` value is never a URI; terms drawn from
external vocabularies are carried by `concepts` instead.

`semanticRole` is scalar; therefore each annotated schema element can carry one
`semanticRole` value.

One containing type MUST NOT declare two direct members with the same value for
any of `phenomenonTime`, `resultTime`, `effectiveTime`, `phenomenonTimeStart`,
`phenomenonTimeEnd`, `effectiveTimeStart`, `effectiveTimeEnd`, `ingestionTime`,
`scheduledTime`, `actualTime`, or `forecastIssueTime`. Each of these roles
identifies one position, and every rule in this document that resolves such a
role to a member presumes one. A type declaring two leaves those rules
unresolvable rather than ambiguous.

The observation-result and feature roles carry no such restriction. Repetition
is meaningful for them, and the sections defining them state what it projects.

### Observation Result Concern {#semantic-role-observation-result-concern}

A record using the roles of this concern, together with the feature and
procedure roles defined below:

      "semanticRole": "resultQuality"
    }
  },
  "required": ["station", "procedure", "result", "quality"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
~~~

#### `observationValue` {#observation-value}

A property carrying the result of an observation act.

An `observationValue` is the outcome of one observation act, not the act
itself. Each act is represented by one complete value in one annotated
property. Structured or composite results can be represented with an object,
tuple, or another compatible compound type. Multiple `observationValue`
properties in the same containing type represent multiple results, not one
combined act.

#### `resultQuality` {#result-quality}

One result-quality value associated with the observation, corresponding to ISO
result semantics {{ISO19156}}.

`resultQuality` qualifies the `observationValue`; it is not the result value
itself.

A single observation act can carry multiple quality qualifiers, and each direct
property with `semanticRole: resultQuality` projects one of them.

The value schema or external vocabulary defines the quality scale. This
specification defines no threshold, ordering, confidence model, or processing
effect. Omission does not imply acceptable quality. Procedure-level quality
metadata describes the measuring process in general and is distinct from
`resultQuality`, which describes one observation result.

  "additionalProperties": false
}
~~~

#### `featureOfInterest` {#feature-of-interest}

Value identifying or describing the feature whose property is observed: the
entity that is the subject of the observation. It is distinct from
`observedProperty`, which identifies which property is observed, from
`observingProcedure`, which identifies how the value is produced, and from
`observationValue`, which carries the result.

The annotated property's value can be a scalar, object, tuple, or collection.
The property schema defines representation, cardinality, and requiredness.

Where the feature is a member of a collection held elsewhere in the document,
JSON Structure Relations {{JSTRUCT-RELATIONS}} states the reference:

~~~ json
{
  "definitions": {
    "HydroGraph": {
      "type": "object",

      },
      "required": ["observationId", "reachIdRef", "waterLevel"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  }
}
~~~

In an instance, `reachIdRef` carries the same identifier value used by
the relation target identity, for example `"RR-1042"`.

#### `proximateFeatureOfInterest` {#proximate-feature-of-interest}

Value identifying or describing the feature directly involved in observing.

This role identifies the immediate feature participating in measurement
context (for example a sampled parcel). Where the observation involves
sampling, this is the feature that ISO 19156 {{ISO19156}} calls a sampling
feature.

#### `ultimateFeatureOfInterest` {#ultimate-feature-of-interest}

Value identifying or describing the feature ultimately of interest.

This role identifies the broader feature for which the observation is
semantically interpreted.

Neither proximate nor ultimate feature is inferred from the other. When
`featureOfInterest` and specialized FoI roles coexist, processors MUST preserve
them as separate declarations and MUST NOT assume equivalence. Feature identity
MUST NOT be inferred from observation identity, location, property names, or
transport metadata.

#### `observingProcedure` {#observing-procedure}

Value identifying or describing the procedure used for the observation act.

Procedure identity is comparability-critical: different procedures can yield
different biases or meanings for the same property and feature. Equality is
evidence for candidate grouping, not proof of statistical interchangeability.
When a shared catalog is available, procedure identifiers SHOULD be expressed
as URIs; a device or instrument registry serves where the procedure is
effectively defined by the instrument or sampler used.

#### `phenomenonTime` {#phenomenon-time}

Time during which the result applies to the observed property. It can be
represented as an instant or period.

When used for an instant, `phenomenonTime` MUST annotate a value whose Core
type and reference binding together encode a temporal position. It MAY instead
annotate a named object or tuple representing a period.

#### `resultTime` {#result-time}

Temporal position at which the result became available.

`resultTime` MUST annotate a value whose Core type and reference binding
together encode a temporal position.

#### `effectiveTime` {#effective-time}

Period during which the record is in force and its use is intended.

`effectiveTime` MAY annotate a named object or tuple representing a period.

`effectiveTime` qualifies the record and not the phenomenon. It states how long
a warning, advisory, or other issued statement is meant to be acted on, and it
gives no boundary to any observed property. A record that describes a period of
the world, including a forecast, states that period with `phenomenonTime` or
with `phenomenonTimeStart` and `phenomenonTimeEnd`. The two are independent: a
warning in force for twelve hours may concern a phenomenon lasting minutes.

This document defines no record-versioning axis. The role is named
`effectiveTime` rather than `validTime` because the latter names the
bitemporal valid time of ISO 19108 {{ISO19108}}. `effectiveTime` is not that
valid time, which pairs the period a fact is held true of the world with the
period a system recorded it, and a processor MUST NOT read it as one.

“Time” or “Duration” in any ISO, boundary, or operational role name defined by
this document does not require a Gregorian, ISO 8601, or RFC 3339 encoding. The
`semanticRole` states semantics; the Core type and any
`temporalReferenceSystem` state representation and reference semantics.

### Temporal Concern (Flattened Period Boundaries) {#semantic-role-temporal-concern-flattened-period-boundaries}

A record using the roles of this concern. The two pairs are independent axes:
the phenomenon-time pair bounds what the result is about, and the
effective-time pair bounds how long the record is in force.

#### `phenomenonTimeStart` {#phenomenon-time-start}

Temporal position encoding the start of the `phenomenonTime` period.

`phenomenonTimeStart` MUST annotate a value whose Core type and reference
binding together encode a temporal position.

#### `phenomenonTimeEnd` {#phenomenon-time-end}

Temporal position encoding the end of the `phenomenonTime` period.

`phenomenonTimeEnd` MUST annotate a value whose Core type and reference
binding together encode a temporal position.

#### `effectiveTimeStart` {#effective-time-start}

Temporal position encoding the start of the `effectiveTime` period.

`effectiveTimeStart` MUST annotate a value whose Core type and reference
binding together encode a temporal position.

#### `effectiveTimeEnd` {#effective-time-end}

Temporal position encoding the end of the `effectiveTime` period.

`effectiveTimeEnd` MUST annotate a value whose Core type and reference binding
together encode a temporal position.

A paired start and end projects one period, not two separate attributes. Period
closure is not supplied by these role names. This specification uses half-open
`[start,end)` periods only for `phenomenonTimeRelation`; another convention requires a
separate representation or profile.

### Temporal Concern (Operational Event Time) {#semantic-role-temporal-concern-operational-event-time}

A planned activity, its execution, and its acceptance by a receiving system:

  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
~~~

#### `ingestionTime` {#ingestion-time}

Temporal position when a declared system accepted the record.

`ingestionTime` MUST annotate a value whose Core type and reference binding
together encode a temporal position.

#### `scheduledTime` {#scheduled-time}

Planned temporal position for an activity.

`scheduledTime` MUST annotate a value whose Core type and reference binding
together encode a temporal position.

#### `actualTime` {#actual-time}

Temporal position when the planned activity occurred.

`actualTime` MUST annotate a value whose Core type and reference binding
together encode a temporal position.

#### `forecastIssueTime` {#forecast-issue-time}

Forecast-specific `resultTime`: the temporal position when a forecast product
was issued.

`forecastIssueTime` MUST annotate a value whose Core type and reference
binding together encode a temporal position.

A forecast record states the position or period it describes with
`phenomenonTime`, or with `phenomenonTimeStart` and `phenomenonTimeEnd`. A
forecast is an observation whose result time precedes its phenomenon time, and
it carries the same temporal roles as any other observation; nothing about the
phenomenon-time roles restricts them to positions that have already elapsed.

#### `forecastLeadDuration` {#forecast-lead-duration}

Duration between the forecast issue position and the phenomenon-time position
the forecast describes.

`forecastLeadDuration` MUST annotate Core `duration` or a numeric value with a
temporal unit {{JSTRUCT-UNITS}}.

    }
  },
  "required": ["station_id", "issued_at", "forecast_window", "predicted_water_level"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
~~~

These operational values describe the handling of the record. A processor MUST
NOT read any of them as `phenomenonTime`, `resultTime`, `observedProperty`,
`featureOfInterest`, or `observingProcedure`.

### Status Concern {#semantic-role-status-concern}

#### `status` {#status}

State of the record itself, or of the feature it describes, such as whether a
value is provisional, verified, superseded, or withdrawn.

`status` MUST annotate a value drawn from a fixed set of states, which is a Core
`string` or an integer type. The states are defined outside this document. The
annotated schema MUST either constrain them with `enum` {{JSTRUCT-CORE}} or
identify the set that defines them, which MAY be a vocabulary referenced via
`concepts`.

`status` qualifies the record rather than the phenomenon. A change of status
does not change what was observed, and a record MAY be reissued with a new
status and an unchanged result.

`status` and `resultQuality` are distinct. `resultQuality` states how good a
result is, on a scale the quality vocabulary defines; `status` states how the
record carrying it is to be treated. A provisional record and a low-quality
result are independent conditions, and a processor MUST NOT read either
annotation as the other.

Example:

~~~ json
{
  "name": "WaterLevelRecord",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "water_level": {
      "type": "double",

      "semanticRole": "status"
    }
  },
  "required": ["water_level", "record_status"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
~~~

## The `derivation` Keyword {#derivation}

The `derivation` keyword classifies how a result value was produced.

When present, `derivation` MUST be one of:

| Derivation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `measured` | Produced directly by an observation procedure performing measurement. |
| `statistic` | Produced by summarizing a set of values with one of the functions named by `statistic` ({{statistic}}). |
| `calculated` | Produced by a deterministic calculation that `statistic` does not name. |
| `estimated` | Inferred from incomplete, indirect, or uncertain evidence. |
| `modeled` | Produced by a model, simulation, or predictive procedure. |

Routine conversion, rounding, or serialization does not by itself change
`measured` to `calculated`. The category identifies no source, formula,
software, or detailed procedure, and it is not a lineage model: it does not
identify the act that produced the value or relate that value to the values it
was derived from ({{PROV-O}}).

`statistic` and `calculated` divide the calculations between them. Where the
result is one of the summaries this document names, the derivation is
`statistic` and the `statistic` keyword names which one, so a reader can tell an
hourly mean from an hourly maximum without reading prose. Every other
calculation is `calculated`, and the schema SHOULD explain the method in the
`description` of the annotated schema. This document defines no expression
language, and a processor MUST NOT parse a `description` or reproduce a
calculation from it.

The names alone do not divide the categories, and the tests below do. They are
stated so that two authors describing the same value reach the same category.

The first division is between `measured` and the rest, and it is the one that
carries the most weight for a consumer. A value is `measured` where it is what
an observation procedure read, and it is not `measured` where any function, fit,
inference, or model stood between the procedure and the value. Unit conversion,
rounding, and serialization are not such functions, as stated above.

Determinism divides `calculated` from `estimated` and `modeled`. Where the same
inputs must yield the same output, and the function could be written down, the
value is `calculated` however elaborate the arithmetic and however many inputs
it consumes. A dew point obtained from a measured temperature and a measured
humidity by a published formula is `calculated`.

Dependence on unobserved state divides `modeled` from `estimated`. An
`estimated` value carries only what the observations carry, arranged under an
assumption about their error: an interpolated fill for a failed sensor, or a
strike position derived from arrival times at several detectors, is `estimated`,
because something was observed and the value is an inference from evidence that
does not determine it. A `modeled` value carries information the observations do
not contain, supplied by the model's own representation of the system, and the
procedure would produce a value for a place and time at which nothing was
observed at all. A forecast temperature is `modeled`. A value that a model
produced and that observations then corrected, as in a reanalysis or an
assimilated field, is `modeled`, because the model supplies the state and the
observations only constrain it.

Where the choice among `calculated`, `estimated`, and `modeled` is genuinely
unclear, the schema SHOULD state the method in `description`. An author MUST NOT
resolve such a case by choosing `measured`, and a processor MUST NOT infer a
formula, a model, an uncertainty, or a procedure from any of these values.

  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "sea_state_index": {
      "type": "double",

      "derivation": "modeled"
    }
  },
  "required": ["sea_state_index"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
~~~

## The `statistic` Keyword {#statistic}

The `statistic` keyword names the summary function that produced a result value
from a set of values.

Most summary functions are fully identified by their name. A few are not: a
percentile is not one function but a family, and naming the family without the
rank identifies nothing. `statistic` therefore takes two forms. A function that
takes no parameter is written as a string, and a function that takes one is
written as an object that names the function and carries the parameter.

When `statistic` is a string, it MUST be one of:

| Statistic | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mean` | Arithmetic mean of the set. |
| `median` | Middle value of the ordered set. |
| `mode` | Most frequent value of the set. |
| `minimum` | Least value of the set. |
| `maximum` | Greatest value of the set. |
| `sum` | Total of the set. |
| `count` | Number of values in the set. |
| `standardDeviation` | Standard deviation of the set. |
| `variance` | Variance of the set. |
| `range` | Difference between the greatest and least value. |

When `statistic` is an object, it MUST carry a `function` member and the
parameter member that `function` requires, and no other members. `function`
MUST be one of:

| Function | Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `percentile` | `percentile` | Value below which the stated percentage of the set falls. |
| `nthHighest` | `rank` | Value at the stated position counting down from the greatest. |
| `nthLowest` | `rank` | Value at the stated position counting up from the least. |

`percentile` MUST be a number greater than zero and less than one hundred, and
`rank` MUST be an integer of two or more. `percentile` MUST be present when
`function` is `percentile` and MUST NOT be present otherwise; `rank` MUST be
present when `function` is `nthHighest` or `nthLowest` and MUST NOT be present
otherwise.

Both enumerations are closed. A `statistic` that is a string outside the first
table, or an object whose `function` is outside the second, is invalid.

One meaning has one spelling. A function that takes no parameter MUST be written
in the string form, so `{ "function": "mean" }` is invalid. A percentile of zero
or one hundred MUST be written as `minimum` or `maximum`, and a rank of one MUST
be written as `maximum` or `minimum`, which is why the ranges above exclude
them. A quantile is expressed as the equivalent percentile, so a quantile of
0.95 is written as a `percentile` of 95. Without these rules two schemas could
declare the same statistic in ways that no equality test would match.

A rank is not a percentile. The fourth-highest value of a set of three hundred
and sixty-five is the 99.18th percentile and of a set of ninety is the 96.7th,
so neither form can be rewritten as the other without knowing how many values
the set held, and `statistic` does not state that. Both forms are needed because
both are what definitions in force actually specify: an air quality limit is
commonly expressed as a rank, and a service level objective as a percentile.

`statistic` and the `statistic` derivation are one declaration in two parts. A
schema whose `derivation` is `statistic` MUST carry a `statistic` keyword, and a
schema carrying a `statistic` keyword MUST have a `derivation` of `statistic`.
The derivation says the value summarizes a set, and the keyword says how. Where
`phenomenonTimeRelation` is `accumulation`,
`statistic` MUST be the string `sum`.

A calculation that no value in either table names is `calculated` rather than
`statistic`, and {{derivation}} states what a schema does instead.

A vocabulary term names the phenomenon and frequently excludes the summary
function, so an hourly mean and an hourly maximum of one phenomenon carry the
same `observedProperty` and differ only here. Two results that carry the same
observable property and different statistics are not comparable as like
quantities. The parameter is part of the statistic: a 95th percentile and a 99th
percentile are different statistics, as are a fourth-highest and a
fifth-highest, and a processor MUST NOT treat two parameterized statistics as
alike unless both the function and the parameter agree.

The set that the statistic summarizes is the one the other annotations already
establish: the temporal roles give its extent in time, and the feature and
procedure roles give its subject. This document defines no other scoping, and
the only argument `statistic` takes is the one that identifies the function.
It does not state a window alignment, a weighting, a sample count, a treatment
of missing values, an interpolation method by which a percentile is obtained
from a finite set, or a computation, and a processor MUST NOT recompute a
result from it.

# Coded Value Annotations {#coded-value-annotations}

## The `codedValues` Keyword {#coded-values}

The `codedValues` keyword binds the annotated property to a code list,
so that the coded value it carries can be resolved to the meaning the list
assigns it.

A coded value is a number or a short string that stands for a state in a
register maintained elsewhere: a present-weather code, an airport identifier, a
diagnosis code. The register gives each code a meaning, and the value alone does
not. This keyword differs from the reference-style keywords that bind components
to the axes of a space in that it binds a single value to a list of meanings, and
it differs from `concepts` in that `concepts` binds the node to one term while
`codedValues` binds the property to a whole enumeration that its instance values
draw from.

When present, `codedValues` MUST be an object with a REQUIRED `reference` and a
REQUIRED `kind`, and no other members.

### The `reference` and `kind` Properties {#coded-values-reference-and-kind}

`reference` identifies one specific code list. It MUST be an absolute URI
{{RFC3986}}, or, where `kind` is `type`, a type reference
`{ "$ref": <JSON Pointer> }` {{JSTRUCT-CORE}} to a shareable type definition that
enumerates the codes. `kind` does not name the list; it classifies the register
model the list belongs to, so that a processor knows how the list is organized
and how a value joins to an entry. Several lists of one model are distinguished
by `reference`, not by `kind`: the country, currency, and language tables are
three `iso` lists, and the location indicators and aircraft type designators are
two `icao` lists. `kind` is an open enumeration; the following values are
defined here:

| Kind | Kind of list |
|---|---|
| `wmo-codes` | A register in the WMO Codes Registry {{WMO-CODES}}. |
| `iso` | An ISO code table, such as the ISO 3166 country codes {{ISO3166}}, the ISO 4217 currency codes {{ISO4217}}, or the ISO 639 language codes {{ISO639}}. |
| `unlocode` | The UN/LOCODE location code list {{UNLOCODE}}. |
| `icao` | An ICAO code list, such as the location indicators of {{ICAO7910}} or the aircraft type designators of {{ICAO8643}}. |
| `iata` | An IATA code directory {{IATA-CODES}}. |
| `iana` | An IANA registry {{IANA-PROTOCOLS}}, such as the Language Subtag Registry {{IANA-LANGTAGS}}. |
| `icd` | A linearization of the WHO International Classification of Diseases {{WHO-ICD}}. |
| `snomed-ct` | A SNOMED CT edition or reference set {{SNOMED-CT}}. |
| `loinc` | The LOINC database {{LOINC}}. |
| `atc` | The WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification {{WHO-ATC}}. |
| `unspsc` | The UNSPSC commodity code set {{UNSPSC}}. |
| `type` | A meta-type in the annotated schema whose enumeration lists the codes, as {{meta-types}} describes. |

The annotated value MUST be of a scalar type, a string or an integer, of the
kind the identified list uses for its notations. Where `kind` is `type`, the
identified type enumerates the code notations, and a value denotes the entry
whose notation it equals.

A value in an instance denotes the entry the register publishes for that value.
How the value is joined to the entry, whether by appending it to the register
URI or by another rule, is stated by the register and not by this document. Some
registers, including {{WMO-CODES}}, publish each entry at a dereferenceable URI;
a reference to such a register identifies more often than it resolves, which is
true of the other reference-style keywords as well.

A missing or unresolved register is indeterminate and MUST NOT be repaired from
labels, property names, descriptions, or samples. A value that the register does
not define is not made meaningful by this annotation.

A processor is not required to dereference the URI. This document does not define
a resolution protocol, URI layout, storage model, or definition serialization.

### Example {#coded-values-example}

The property below carries a present-weather code from the WMO register for
present weather, whose entries are the integers zero through several hundred.

# Measurement Conditioning Annotations {#measurement-conditioning}

## The `measurementConditioning` Keyword {#measurement-conditioning-keyword}

The `measurementConditioning` keyword states the frequency weighting, time
weighting, and level reference that a scalar measurement carries, so that two values of
the same unit that were conditioned differently are not compared as like
quantities.

A weighted level is a single number, not a bundle of channels, and its unit does
not record how it was made. An A-weighted sound level and a Z-weighted one are
both in decibels, and comparing them is a mistake the numbers do not prevent.
The weighting, the time constant, and the reference the level stands against are
the hidden convention this keyword carries.

When present, `measurementConditioning` MUST be an object with an OPTIONAL
`weighting`, an OPTIONAL `timeWeighting`, and an OPTIONAL `levelReference`, and no
other members. At least one of the three MUST be present. The annotated value
MUST be of numeric type.

### The `weighting` Property {#measurement-conditioning-keyword-weighting}

`weighting`, when present, names the frequency weighting the value carries. It is
an open enumeration; the values defined here are the frequency weightings of
{{IEC61672-1}}:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `a` | A-weighting. |
| `c` | C-weighting. |
| `z` | Zero-weighting, the flat response. |

### The `timeWeighting` Property {#measurement-conditioning-keyword-time-weighting}

`timeWeighting`, when present, names the time weighting the value carries. It is
an open enumeration; the values defined here are the time weightings of
{{IEC61672-1}}:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `fast` | Fast time weighting. |
| `slow` | Slow time weighting. |

The impulse time weighting of the superseded IEC 651 is not among these; where a
legacy dataset needs it, it is carried as an open value.

### The `levelReference` Property {#level-reference}

`levelReference`, when present, states what the level is relative to. This is one
property appearing in two keywords: the `levelReference` of `audioChannels`
({{audio-level-reference}}) takes the same values with the same meanings, since
both answer the same question about a quantity expressed on a logarithmic scale.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `soundPressure` | The reference is 20 micropascals {{ISO1683}}, and a level in decibels is sound pressure level. |
| `fullScale` | The reference is digital full scale, the greatest level the representation admits, and a level in decibels is dBFS. |

The enumeration is open. A value outside it MUST be an absolute URI {{RFC3986}}
identifying another reference, because a level may be referred to a voltage, a
power, or a quantity that the standard governing an instrument fixes, and this
document does not enumerate what other bodies define. A processor that does not
know a value MUST preserve it, MUST NOT reject the schema for carrying it, and
MUST NOT compare a level against one carrying a different reference.

### Example {#measurement-conditioning-keyword-example}

The property below carries an A-weighted, fast, sound-pressure level.

~~~ json
{
  "name": "NoiseReading",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "sensorId": { "type": "string" },
    "soundLevel": {
      "type": "double",
      "unit": "dB",
      "measurementConditioning": {
        "weighting": "a",
        "timeWeighting": "fast",
        "levelReference": "soundPressure"
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["sensorId", "soundLevel"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}

# Reference System Meta-Types {#meta-types}

A reference system need not be published by an authority. Where the `kind` of a
reference-system keyword is `type`, `reference` is a type reference
`{ "$ref": <JSON Pointer> }` {{JSTRUCT-CORE}} to a shareable type definition, and
that type definition is the
definition of the system. Such a type is a meta-type. It is ordinarily
maintained in its own document and brought into `definitions` with `$import`
{{JSTRUCT-IMPORT}}, so that one definition serves every schema that cites it.

A meta-type declares the members of the system, and the annotation maps the
members of the annotated schema onto them. The two need not agree in member
names, member order, or member count.

A meta-type is an ordinary type definition that a schema author writes, and it
is unrelated to the extension meta-schema of {{extension-meta-schema}}, which is
the schema of this specification.

## The `referenceRole` Keyword {#reference-role}

`referenceRole` states the function of a member within a meta-type. It MAY occur
on a property, collection item, map value, or choice member schema of a type
that a `reference` identifies, and it establishes nothing elsewhere.

When present, `referenceRole` MUST be one of:

| Value | Function of the member |
|---|---|
| `position` | Carries a temporal position, mapped by `position` ({{temporal-reference-systems}}). |
| `linearElement` | Identifies a linear element, mapped by `linearElement` ({{linear-reference-systems}}). |
| `measure` | Carries a distance along a linear element, mapped by `measure`. |
| `direction` | Qualifies direction of travel or orientation, mapped by `direction`. |

One meta-type MUST NOT declare two members with the same `referenceRole`. A
member without `referenceRole` is a component of the system that no annotation
maps, and an annotated schema MAY carry it, under any name, or omit it.

A mapping is established by `referenceRole` and never by a member name. A
processor MUST NOT infer a role from the name of a member, and a meta-type that
declares no member for a role a keyword requires is unusable by that keyword.

A coordinate reference system takes no roles, because its meta-type is a `tuple`
and the order of its elements establishes the axes ({{coordinate-reference-systems}}).
A vector reference frame takes no roles for the same reason
({{vector-reference-frames}}).

# Temporal Reference Annotations {#temporal-reference-annotations}

The keywords in this section concern temporal positions, the values that place
an observation or an operational event on a time line.
`phenomenonTimeRelation` states how a result relates to the position it
accompanies, `supportPeriod` gives the length of the period a result
characterizes where the record bounds it at one end, `temporalReferenceSystem`
states how a position value is to be read, and `cadence` states how successive
positions are expected to recur.

## The `phenomenonTimeRelation` Keyword {#phenomenon-time-relation}

The `phenomenonTimeRelation` keyword refines how a result value relates to
`phenomenonTime`. When `semanticRole: observationValue` is also present, it
describes the observation result. It is not a replacement for `phenomenonTime`.

When present, it MUST be one of:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `instant` | Result applies at the sibling temporal position having role `phenomenonTime`. |
| `untilNext` | Result applies from that position until the next actual compatible observation. |
| `interval` | Result characterizes a half-open phenomenon-time period the record encodes. |
| `accumulation` | Result is accumulated over that half-open phenomenon-time period. |

`instant` and `untilNext` can be resolved only when a sibling
`phenomenonTime` annotation identifies a temporal position. `interval` and
`accumulation` can be resolved when sibling `phenomenonTimeStart` and
`phenomenonTimeEnd` annotations identify boundaries in a common reference regime
or through an authoritative conversion, and can be resolved when `supportPeriod`
states the length of the period and a sibling position anchors it
({{support-period}}). Otherwise the support is declared but its temporal extent
is indeterminate. Effective-time and operational roles do not supply
phenomenon-time boundaries.

These values state how a result relates to a phenomenon time and not how it was
produced; the summary function, where there is one, is carried by `statistic`
({{statistic}}). They do not authorize summation or prove complete coverage. For
`untilNext`, the successor is the next actual observation with compatible
resolved feature of interest, observed property, declared procedure, value
type, unit, temporal binding, and support. Cadence does not prove a successor
exists; without one the support end is unknown. Omission is not `instant`.

Example. `air_temperature` holds until the next compatible observation, so it
reads against the sibling `phenomenonTime`; `rainfall` is accumulated over the
period, so it reads against the sibling boundary pair:

~~~ json
{
  "name": "WeatherReport",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "observed_at": {
      "type": "datetime",
      "semanticRole": "phenomenonTime"
    },
    "window_opens": {
      "type": "datetime",
      "semanticRole": "phenomenonTimeStart"
    },
    "window_closes": {
      "type": "datetime",
      "semanticRole": "phenomenonTimeEnd"
    },

      "type": "double",
      "unit": "Cel",
      "semanticRole": "observationValue",
      "phenomenonTimeRelation": "untilNext"
    },
    "rainfall": {
      "type": "double",
      "unit": "mm",
      "semanticRole": "observationValue",
      "phenomenonTimeRelation": "accumulation"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "observed_at",
    "window_opens",
    "window_closes",
    "air_temperature",
    "rainfall"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
~~~

## The `supportPeriod` Keyword {#support-period}

The `supportPeriod` keyword states the length of the phenomenon-time period a
result characterizes, for a period the record bounds at one end rather than two.
A mean wind speed over the ten minutes ending at the observation time, a
half-hourly settlement quantity stamped with the instant its period opens, and a
pressure change over the preceding three hours are all of that shape: the length
is fixed by the publishing arrangement, and one position in the record fixes
where the period sits. Such a feed carries no second boundary and gains nothing
from a schema that invents a member for one.

When present, `supportPeriod` MUST be an object with a REQUIRED `length` and a
REQUIRED `anchor`. No other properties are permitted.

### The `length` Property {#support-period-length}

`length` states the extent of the period and MUST express a positive interval in
the temporal reference system applicable to the anchoring position. For a Core
`datetime`, `date`, or `time`, it MUST be a positive Core `duration`. Another
temporal reference system MAY use a numeric, string, or structured interval
representation defined by that system, on the terms {{cadence}} states for
`period`.

### The `anchor` Property {#support-period-anchor}

`anchor` states which boundary of the period the anchoring position occupies and
MUST be one of:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `start` | The anchoring position opens the period, which runs forward from it. |
| `end` | The anchoring position closes the period, which runs back to it. |

The anchoring position is the sibling annotated `phenomenonTimeStart` when
`anchor` is `start`, and the sibling annotated `phenomenonTimeEnd` when `anchor`
is `end`. Where the record carries no member in that role, the anchoring
position is the sibling annotated `phenomenonTime`. Where it carries neither,
the period has a length and no location, and the extent remains indeterminate.

The period is half-open on the terms {{phenomenon-time-relation}} states. For an
anchoring position `t`, an `anchor` of `end` gives `[t - length, t)` and an
`anchor` of `start` gives `[t, t + length)`.

`supportPeriod` MUST NOT be present unless `phenomenonTimeRelation` is
`interval` or `accumulation`, and MUST NOT be present where sibling
`phenomenonTimeStart` and `phenomenonTimeEnd` annotations both identify
boundaries, because the record then encodes the period and a stated length would
restate or contradict it.

The boundary roles do not subsume this keyword. `phenomenonTimeStart` and
`phenomenonTimeEnd` annotate members, so they state a period only where the
record carries a value at each end of it, and the resolution rules of this
document read one sibling in each role. Support is a property of a result
rather than of a record, and one record may carry results of differing extent:
a buoy report may close a twenty-minute wave summary and a three-hour pressure
change at a single observation time, leaving one place to put a boundary and
two periods to state. `supportPeriod` is carried by the result it describes,
so each result states its own extent, and a length fixed by the publishing
arrangement is stated once in the schema rather than transmitted in every
record.

A support period is a fact about one value and a cadence is a fact about a
producer. The two are often numerically equal and are never the same statement.
A station reporting hourly a mean taken over the last ten minutes of each hour
has a cadence of one hour and a support period of ten minutes, and a schema
declaring only the cadence would leave a reader free to treat fifty minutes of
every hour as observed. `cadence` does not bound a phenomenon time
({{cadence}}), and `supportPeriod` asserts nothing about whether a successor
record exists or when it arrives.

Where the length is not fixed by the schema, because it varies with the station,
the instrument, or the message, there is no length to state and a schema MUST
NOT state a nominal one. The extent is then indeterminate, and a schema SHOULD
record in `description` what governs the length, so that a reader learns where
to obtain it rather than assuming a value.

Example. A surface report carries a mean wind speed over the ten minutes ending
at the observation time and a rainfall total accumulated over the hour that
opens at the stated instant. The record has one boundary member and two periods:

~~~ json
{
  "name": "SurfaceReport",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "observed_at": {
      "type": "datetime",
      "examples": ["2026-07-27T12:50:00Z"],
      "semanticRole": "phenomenonTime"
    },
    "accumulation_opens": {
      "type": "datetime",
      "examples": ["2026-07-27T12:00:00Z"],
      "semanticRole": "phenomenonTimeStart"
    },
    "wind_speed": {
      "type": "double",
      "unit": "m/s",
      "semanticRole": "observationValue",
      "derivation": "statistic",
      "statistic": "mean",
      "phenomenonTimeRelation": "interval",
      "supportPeriod": { "length": "PT10M", "anchor": "end" }
    },
    "rainfall": {
      "type": "double",
      "unit": "mm",
      "semanticRole": "observationValue",
      "derivation": "measured",
      "phenomenonTimeRelation": "accumulation",
      "supportPeriod": { "length": "PT1H", "anchor": "start" }
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "observed_at",
    "accumulation_opens",
    "wind_speed",
    "rainfall"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
~~~

The record carries no `phenomenonTimeEnd`, so `wind_speed` anchors on
`observed_at` and covers `[12:40Z, 12:50Z)`. `rainfall` anchors on
`accumulation_opens` and covers `[12:00Z, 13:00Z)`. The two periods overlap and
neither is the other, and a reader that took the observation instant for both
would attribute the hour's rain to ten minutes of it.

## The `temporalReferenceSystem` Keyword {#temporal-reference-systems}

The `temporalReferenceSystem` keyword identifies the temporal reference
definition needed to interpret an encoded temporal position or duration.

It attaches to a temporally typed property or to a type definition that serves
as one. Where that type is an object or tuple, `position` names the member that
carries the position value.

When present, `temporalReferenceSystem` MUST be an object with a REQUIRED
`reference` string, a REQUIRED `kind` string, an OPTIONAL `position` string, and
an OPTIONAL `sortOrder` string. No other properties are permitted.

Core temporal types need no annotation when their Core semantics are fully
intended. A non-Core or ambiguous encoding is indeterminate without one.

### The `reference` Property {#temporal-reference-systems-reference}

`reference` MUST identify one temporal reference definition. Where `kind` is
`type` it MUST be a type reference `{ "$ref": <JSON Pointer> }` {{JSTRUCT-CORE}}
to a shareable type
definition, and otherwise it MUST be an absolute URI {{RFC3986}}. `kind` states
which definition model the reference identifies. This document does not define a
resolution protocol, URI layout, storage model, or definition serialization.

Where the identified definition has a domain of validity, an annotated position
MUST lie in that domain.

### The `kind` Property {#temporal-reference-systems-kind}

`kind` classifies which definition model the URI identifies. It is an open
enumeration. The following values are defined here:

| Kind | Referenced definition |
|---|---|
| `ogc-trs` | A concept in the OGC temporal reference system register, whose entries follow ISO 19108 {{ISO19108}}. |
| `ogc-temporal-crs` | A GML `TemporalCRS` served by the OGC definitions server, establishing a temporal datum, origin, and coordinate system {{ISO19111}} {{OGC-TOPIC2}}. |
| `type` | A meta-type declaring a member whose `referenceRole` is `position`, alongside the components of the regime ({{meta-types}}). |

Other values MAY name further definition models. {{reference-uris}} lists
resolvable URIs for the registered kinds.

Whichever model a `kind` names, the identified definition MUST establish the
components applicable to the encoding it governs. Where it defines a compound
regime that locates a position by scoped components {{OGC-TOPIC25}}, it MUST
state component order, the scope and reset behavior of each component, and the
rules for comparing positions from different scopes.

A `type` reference carries a regime that no register holds. The referenced
meta-type MUST declare a member whose `referenceRole` is `position`, and the
type and unit of that member establish the encoding. The `position` property
maps the annotated member onto it. The remaining members of the meta-type are
components of the regime that the annotation does not map. What a type
definition cannot express, such as reset behavior and comparison across scopes,
is stated in its `description`.

### The `position` Property {#temporal-reference-systems-position}

`position` is REQUIRED when the annotation is attached to an object or tuple
and is prohibited otherwise. It MUST name a direct member of that object or
tuple, and that member MUST be REQUIRED.

The named member carries the temporal position. Its values MUST sort in the
direction given by `sortOrder` under the ordering defined for its own type,
which for a string is lexical order. A compound position achieves this by
rendering its components most significant first at fixed width. A processor can
therefore order and compare positions without implementing the referenced
definition.

The remaining members MAY hold the individual components, identifiers, or other
detail. A processor is not required to interpret them.

### The `sortOrder` Property {#temporal-reference-systems-sort-order}

`sortOrder` states how the ordering of the encoded value runs relative to
temporal order. When present, it MUST be one of:

| Value | Ordering |
|---|---|
| `forward` | An increasing value is a later position. |
| `backward` | An increasing value is an earlier position. |

When `sortOrder` is absent, the value is `forward`.

Most definitions count from an epoch toward the present and are therefore
`forward`. An annotation citing a definition whose values count away from a
datum into the past, such as years before present or a geologic time scale,
MUST declare `sortOrder` as `backward`.

`sortOrder` applies to the annotated value, or to the member named by `position`
where one is named. It states the direction of the ordering and nothing else,
and a definition whose values do not order under their own type at all is not
made orderable by declaring either value.

### Type Compatibility {#temporal-reference-systems-type-compatibility}

The referenced definition establishes an encoding, and the annotated schema
MUST be able to carry it:

| Encoding established by the definition | Compatible schema |
|---|---|
| A date and time in a calendar, following {{RFC3339}} | Core `datetime`, `date`, `time`, or `string` |
| A count of units elapsed from an epoch | a Core integer or number type |
| Any other encoding | `string`, or an object or tuple carrying `position` |

Where the definition establishes a unit for its axis, a numeric position MUST
carry a `unit` or `ucumUnit` annotation compatible with that unit. Epoch
definitions differ in unit, so a count of seconds and a count of milliseconds
from the same origin are distinct definitions rather than one definition with
two encodings.

How much of this a reader can check depends on `kind`. An `ogc-temporal-crs`
definition determines the encoding, since its axis states either a unit of
measure, which takes a numeric position, or a date and time, which takes a
string. A `type` definition declares the type of each component and likewise
determines it. An `ogc-trs` concept names a time scale and establishes no axis,
unit, or encoding, so the compatibility check is indeterminate, as it is for a
`kind` outside this enumeration.

The annotation does not change the JSON base type, turn a data value into an
identifiable temporal object, or supply a conversion. A processor MUST compare,
order, or combine positions only within the same binding or through an
authoritative transformation. A position whose definition establishes only
order MUST NOT be treated as a metric coordinate without additional authority.
Property names alone establish none of these semantics.

Example. The clock is defined once as a meta-type and cited by `reference`, so
a record of another shape can name the same definition. The record names the
mapped member `ordinal` rather than `clockPosition`, and `position` establishes
the mapping; the remaining components are carried under the record's own names
and are not mapped. `ordinal` renders the components at fixed width, so a
processor can order two positions without implementing the definition.

      },

    }
  }
}
~~~

The compound position is comparable only under the rules of the identified
regime: equal stint, lap, and distance values do not imply equal positions
across sessions or entries. Mapping this clock to UTC or elapsed session time
requires an authoritative synchronization relation or transformation.

## The `cadence` Keyword {#cadence}

The `cadence` keyword describes expected producer behavior across successive
values of an annotated temporal position. A temporal role such as
`phenomenonTime`, `resultTime`, `ingestionTime`, or `forecastIssueTime`, when
also present, gives that sequence an observation or operational meaning.

When present, `cadence` MUST be an object with a REQUIRED `kind` string and an
OPTIONAL `period`. No other properties are permitted.

### The `kind` Property {#cadence-kind}

`kind` states the expected recurrence pattern and MUST be one of:

| Kind | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `fixed` | Observations are expected at a regular period. |
| `irregular` | Observations occur without a regular period. |
| `onChange` | Observations occur when represented state changes. |

### The `period` Property {#cadence-period}

`period` is REQUIRED when `kind` is `fixed` and is prohibited otherwise. It
MUST express a positive interval in the temporal reference system applicable to
the annotated temporal position. For a Core `datetime`, `date`, or `time`, it
MUST be a positive Core `duration`. Another temporal reference system MAY use a
numeric, string, or structured interval representation defined by that system.

That latitude is what makes a rapid cadence expressible, and a schema for one
SHOULD use it rather than force the period into civil time. A duration is
written in seconds and their decimal fractions, and many rates that are exact on
their own clock have no exact expression there: audio sampled at 48 kHz advances
one frame every 1/48000 of a second, so any duration written for it is rounded,
and a consumer that places positions by accumulating it drifts further from the
truth with every frame. Writing the period more exactly does not help, because
civil time cannot express the instants either. A stream whose positions are
counted is not a stream whose positions are seconds.

Where the values are counted on a clock of their own, the schema declares that
clock as a meta-type, names it in `temporalReferenceSystem`
({{temporal-reference-systems}}), and gives `period` as a count of that clock's
own units, which for a value recorded once per tick is the integer 1. The
cadence is then exact, because it is stated in the system the values are
expressed in.

The conversion to seconds is data rather than annotation. A rate varies from one
delivery to the next while the schema stays the same, so a member of the record
carries it, annotated with a `unit` {{JSTRUCT-UNITS}}, and a consumer MUST NOT
assume a conventional value for it. Where a schema serves one rate and no other,
`const` or `enum` {{JSTRUCT-CORE}} pins the value on that member.

No keyword binds a clock to the member carrying its rate. A processor MUST NOT
take a member to be the rate of a clock because of the member's name or because
its unit is one of frequency, and MUST NOT convert a position counted on such a
clock to elapsed civil time unless a relation to civil time is established
outside these annotations. The meta-type declaring the clock states that
relation, or its absence, in its `description` ({{temporal-reference-systems}}).

Cadence is not delivery time, a service-level objective, a completeness
assertion, or a phenomenon-time boundary. It does not assert that every
position has a record, that records arrive in order, or that an `untilNext`
successor exists.

Cadence is an expectation and not a constraint, and the distinction is
normative. A schema that declares a cadence constrains no instance document. An
instance whose values do not follow the declared cadence is not invalid for that
reason, because a stream that misses a beat is late rather than malformed, and a
processor MUST NOT reject an instance, a value, or a schema on the ground that
observed timing departs from a declared cadence. A runtime service level belongs
to an agreement between a producer and a consumer, not to a schema.

A consumer may still act on a cadence. A declared period sizes a window, sets a
threshold beyond which a value is treated as stale, and makes an absent value
detectable as a gap rather than absorbed silently. Each of those is a decision
the consumer makes about its own processing. None of them changes the meaning of
a value, and none licenses a value to be supplied where none was recorded
({{security-considerations}}).

The cadence here is one sample-clock unit and is exact. Written as a duration it
could only have been approximated: `PT0.0000208333S` is short of a
forty-eight-kilohertz frame by about thirty-three picoseconds, which is nothing
in one frame and a full sample every thirteen seconds of programme, growing
without bound for as long as the recording runs.

# Spatial Reference Annotations {#spatial-reference-annotations}

Each keyword in this section has two parts. `reference` and `kind` identify an
external definition of a reference system. The remaining properties bind the
components of that system to named members of the object or tuple carrying the
annotation. A position or a vector is held across several members, so these
keywords attach to a complex type and are not meaningful on a scalar.

## The `coordinateReferenceSystem` Keyword {#coordinate-reference-systems}

The `coordinateReferenceSystem` keyword identifies the coordinate reference
system {{ISO19111}} under which coordinate values held in properties of an
object or tuple are to be interpreted.

When present, `coordinateReferenceSystem` MUST be an object with a REQUIRED
`reference` string, a REQUIRED `kind` string, and a REQUIRED `coordinates`
array. No other properties are permitted.

### The `reference` Property {#coordinate-reference-systems-reference}

`reference` MUST identify one coordinate reference system whose definition
establishes an ordered set of axes, each with an axis direction and unit of
measure. Where `kind` is `type` it MUST be a type reference
`{ "$ref": <JSON Pointer> }` {{JSTRUCT-CORE}} to a shareable type definition, and
otherwise it MUST be an absolute
URI {{RFC3986}}. `kind` states which definition model the reference identifies.

A processor is not required to dereference the URI, and a returned
representation need not expose the axes. This document does not define
a resolution protocol, URI layout, storage model, or definition serialization.

### The `kind` Property {#coordinate-reference-systems-kind}

`kind` classifies which definition model the URI identifies. It is an open
enumeration. The following values are defined here:

| Kind | Referenced definition |
|---|---|
| `ogc-crs` | A GML CRS served by the OGC definitions server, named according to the OGC name type specification {{OGC-NAMES}}. |
| `epsg` | A record in the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset {{EPSG}}. |
| `type` | A meta-type that is a `tuple` whose elements in order are the axes of an engineering or local system ({{meta-types}}). |

Other values MAY name further definition models.

A `type` reference carries an engineering or local system that no register
holds. The referenced meta-type MUST be a `tuple`, and the order given by its
`tuple` keyword is the axis order. `coordinates` maps the annotated properties
onto those elements by position, so the number of names in `coordinates` MUST
equal the number of elements and each element establishes the unit of its axis.
Axis direction, datum, and origin are stated in the `description` of the
meta-type or of its elements.

Schema authors SHOULD use a registered definition where one exists.
{{reference-uris}} lists resolvable URIs for the registered kinds.

### The `coordinates` Property {#coordinate-reference-systems-coordinates}

`coordinates` MUST be a non-empty ordered array of distinct property names.
Every name MUST resolve to a direct property of the annotated object or tuple.
The property at array index zero supplies axis 1 of the referenced coordinate
system, the property at index one supplies axis 2, and so on. The number of
names MUST equal the dimension of that coordinate system.

This ordering is an assertion by the schema author. It is not inferred from
property names or from a representation returned by dereferencing `reference`.

A name in `coordinates` MAY resolve to a property whose type is `array` or
`tuple`. Where it does resolve to an `array`, that name MUST be the only entry
in `coordinates`, and the elements of the array instances MUST supply the axes
in order rather than the named property supplying one axis.

For a `tuple`, the number of elements MUST equal the dimension of the
referenced system. A schema using an `array` SHOULD constrain its length. The
axes of a coordinate reference system may carry differing units, which a
`tuple` can state per element and an `array` cannot.

Coordinate properties MUST have numeric types. When a coordinate property has a
`unit` or `ucumUnit` annotation, that unit MUST be compatible with the
corresponding axis. A processor MAY verify the asserted ordering, units, and
dimension using a trusted authority-specific CRS database. Without such a
definition source, it MUST preserve the declaration but treat those checks and
coordinate transformations as indeterminate.

Properties not named by `coordinates` are not part of the coordinate. The
annotation therefore applies safely to an existing object that also contains
identity, temporal, status, or other values.

An object or tuple MUST NOT carry more than one `coordinateReferenceSystem`
annotation. An object containing multiple coordinates SHOULD model each
coordinate as a nested object. This document does not define coordinate epochs
for dynamic coordinate reference systems.

The coordinate order is significant. OGC CRS84 uses longitude, latitude:

~~~ json
{
  "name": "Crs84Position",
  "type": "object",
  "coordinateReferenceSystem": {
    "reference": "http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84",
    "kind": "ogc-crs",
    "coordinates": ["lon", "lat"]
  },
  "properties": {
    "lat": {
      "type": "double",
      "unit": "deg"
    },
    "lon": {
      "type": "double",
      "unit": "deg"
    }
  },
  "required": ["lat", "lon"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
~~~

EPSG:4326 {{EPSG}} uses its authoritative latitude, longitude axis order:

~~~ json
{
  "name": "Epsg4326Position",
  "type": "object",
  "coordinateReferenceSystem": {
    "reference": "http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326",
    "kind": "ogc-crs",
    "coordinates": ["lat", "lon"]
  },
  "properties": {
    "lat": {
      "type": "double",
      "unit": "deg"
    },
    "lon": {
      "type": "double",
      "unit": "deg"
    }
  },
  "required": ["lat", "lon"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
~~~

### Vertical and Compound Systems {#coordinate-reference-systems-vertical-and-compound-systems}

A vertical coordinate reference system has one axis, and `coordinates` then
names one property. This is the binding that makes a height or a depth
interpretable, because the number and its unit do not state what the value is
measured from.

The axis direction comes from the referenced definition and not from the
annotation, so whether the axis is positive up or positive down is a fact about
the identified system. Where `kind` is `type`, the `description` of the
meta-type or of its elements states it.

The following excerpt binds a gauge reading to NAVD88 height:

~~~ json
{
  "name": "GaugeHeightObservation",
  "type": "object",
  "coordinateReferenceSystem": {
    "reference": "http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/5703",
    "kind": "ogc-crs",
    "coordinates": ["water_level"]
  },
  "properties": {
    "station": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Observed gauging station",
      "examples": ["USGS-12149000"],
      "semanticRole": "featureOfInterest"
    },
    "measured_at": {
      "type": "datetime",
      "examples": ["2026-07-27T12:00:00Z"],
      "semanticRole": "phenomenonTime"
    },
    "water_level": {
      "type": "double",
      "unit": "m",
      "description": "Water surface elevation",
      "examples": [2.47],
      "semanticRole": "observationValue"
    }
  },
  "required": ["station", "measured_at", "water_level"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
~~~

Where a horizontal position and a height belong to one compound system, that
system has one definition and one set of axes, so a single annotation names all
of them in order. The annotation of such an object reads:

~~~ json
{
  "coordinateReferenceSystem": {
    "reference": "http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/6349",
    "kind": "ogc-crs",
    "coordinates": ["lat", "lon", "height"]
  }
}
~~~

Where the height belongs to a different system from the horizontal position, or
where it is a result rather than part of a position, the two are separate
bindings. Since an object carries at most one `coordinateReferenceSystem`, the
schema models one of them as a nested object:

~~~ json
{
  "name": "StationWaterLevel",
  "type": "object",
  "coordinateReferenceSystem": {
    "reference": "http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/5703",
    "kind": "ogc-crs",
    "coordinates": ["water_level"]
  },
  "properties": {
    "station_position": {
      "type": "object",
      "coordinateReferenceSystem": {
        "reference": "http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84",
        "kind": "ogc-crs",
        "coordinates": ["lon", "lat"]
      },
      "properties": {
        "lat": { "type": "double", "unit": "deg" },
        "lon": { "type": "double", "unit": "deg" }
      },
      "required": ["lat", "lon"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    },
    "water_level": {
      "type": "double",
      "unit": "m",
      "examples": [2.47],
      "semanticRole": "observationValue"
    }
  },
  "required": ["station_position", "water_level"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
~~~

This specification does not define a CRS, datum, coordinate operation, or
transformation. Those definitions and semantics come from ISO 19111 and the
referenced authority.

## The `vectorReferenceFrames` Keyword {#vector-reference-frames}

The `vectorReferenceFrames` keyword identifies the reference frames on whose
axes the components of vector quantities held in properties of an object or
tuple are resolved.

A vector quantity has a magnitude and a direction, and its components are its
projections onto the axes of a frame, meaningless apart from it. A frame is an
ordered set of axis directions and has no origin, because moving the origin does
not change a vector, whereas a coordinate reference system has one, fixed by its
datum. A record may carry both kinds of quantity: `coordinateReferenceSystem`
binds the members that give a position ({{coordinate-reference-systems}}), and
`vectorReferenceFrames` binds the members that give the components of a vector.

A frame contributes directions only, and so does not establish the units of the
members it binds. The axes of a coordinate reference system may carry differing
units, as in a geographic system with two angles and a height, but the
components of a vector all carry the unit of the quantity. The units of the
members named by one frame MUST be mutually convertible and SHOULD be identical.

When present, `vectorReferenceFrames` MUST be a non-empty array. Each element
MUST be an object with REQUIRED `reference`, `kind`, and `components`, an
OPTIONAL `variance`, and no other members. The keyword is an array because a
single record may carry more than one vector quantity, and each quantity is
resolved in its own frame.

### The `reference` and `kind` Properties {#vector-reference-frames-reference-and-kind}

`reference` and `kind` have the same value space and the same meaning as in
`coordinateReferenceSystem` ({{coordinate-reference-systems}}), under one added
condition: the axes of the referenced system MUST be directions rather than
angles, since a component is a projection onto a direction.

A registered coordinate reference system establishes axis directions, so it may
serve as a frame wherever that condition holds. Registries exist to identify
positions, so most frames in which vectors are reported are not registered
anywhere. Such a frame is written as a `tuple` meta-type whose members, in the
order given by `tuple`, are the axes, and whose member `description` values
state the direction each axis points in. The meta-type establishes the axes and
their order, not the units of the annotated members.

### The `components` Property {#vector-reference-frames-components}

`components` behaves as `coordinates` does. It MUST be a non-empty array of
names, and it takes one of two forms. In the first, every name is that of a
direct property of numeric type, and the names are mapped by position onto the
axes of the frame. In the second, the array holds exactly one name, that of a
direct property whose type is `array` or `tuple` and whose elements are of
numeric type, and the elements of that property MUST supply the axes in order
rather than the named property supplying one axis. Because the components of a
vector all carry one unit, an `array` serves here where it would not serve for a
coordinate.

Every name in `components` MUST resolve to a direct property of the annotated
object or tuple. The names within one `components` array MUST be distinct, since
one value cannot be the component along two axes of one frame. The number of
axes supplied, whether by the names of the first form or by the elements of the
single property of the second, MUST equal the number of axes the frame declares.
The ordering is an assertion by the schema author and is never inferred.

### The `variance` Property {#variance}

`variance` states how the components respond to a change of frame. When present,
it MUST be one of:

| Value | Response |
|---|---|
| `contravariant` | The components transform with the change of frame, as those of a displacement or a velocity do. |
| `covariant` | The components transform with the inverse transpose of the change of frame, as those of a gradient or a surface normal do. |

Writing `M` for the matrix that carries coordinates in one frame into
coordinates in another, in the sense {{transform-conventions}} fixes, a
contravariant triple `v` becomes `M v` and a covariant triple `w` becomes the
inverse transpose of `M` applied to `w`. The change of frame is the passive one:
the quantity does not move, the frame does.

When `variance` is absent, the value is `contravariant`. That is the default
because the quantities most often reported, among them displacements,
velocities, accelerations, and forces, are contravariant, and the covariant
ones, among them gradients and surface normals, are the ones a schema author is
likelier to be conscious of having.

The distinction is invisible where two frames differ by a rotation alone,
because the inverse transpose of a rotation is that rotation. It becomes visible
as soon as they differ by a scaling or a shear. A surface normal carried through
a non-uniform scaling by the rule that carries a displacement ceases to be
perpendicular to the surface it describes, and a pressure gradient carried the
same way reports the wrong rate of change. A processor that re-expresses
components without reading `variance` is right for rotations and wrong for
everything else, which is what this member exists to prevent.

### Multiple Frames and Shared Components {#vector-reference-frames-multiple-frames-and-shared-components}

Two elements MAY cite the same `reference`, which is how a record reporting two
distinct vector quantities in one frame is written. A property MAY be named by
more than one element, which asserts that the frames share that axis and that
the value is the same component in both, and is how one quantity expressed in
two frames is written. The assertion is the schema author's, and a processor
MUST NOT infer a shared axis from a shared property, from the names of the
frames, or from equal values in samples.

Two elements that name one property MUST declare the same `variance`, or omit it
in both. Components of differing variance along one shared axis agree under a
rotation and part company under any other change of frame, so one value cannot
stand for both.

A property MAY also be named both by `vectorReferenceFrames` and by the
`coordinateReferenceSystem` of the same object or tuple, as a position vector
is. Where it is, the unit established by the coordinate axis and the unit borne
by the components of the vector MUST be mutually convertible.

`vectorReferenceFrames` binds vector quantities and nothing else. A rotation, a
stress, a strain, or any other quantity whose components take more than one axis
index is bound by `tensorReferenceFrames` ({{tensor-reference-frames}}), since
the declared order of a single frame cannot state which axis each component
belongs to. A quaternion carrying a rotation is bound by neither keyword: three
of its four members lie along the axes of a frame and the fourth does not, so no
ordered list of components states its binding.

A reference that does not resolve leaves the frame indeterminate. It does not
make the annotation incorrect.

In the following example a satellite navigation receiver reports a position and
a velocity. EPSG:4979 fixes the position; two of its three axes are angles, so
it cannot serve as a vector frame, and the velocity cites EPSG:4978, whose axes
are geocentric X, Y, and Z. Re-expressing the record in another system would
move the position by the whole of the transformation and would turn the velocity
by its rotation alone, which is the distinction the two keywords carry.

Most frames have no registered identifier. In the next example a magnetic field
is reported in two such frames, each written as a meta-type. The frames share
their first axis, so the schema reports that component once, under `bx`, and
names it in both elements. The remaining components differ between the frames
and are carried separately.

The frames are written separately because they differ, and they share their
first axis because both take x from the Earth towards the Sun. The axis
directions are those the NASA Satellite Situation Center states for these two
frames {{SSC-COORDS}}.

This specification does not define a frame, an epoch, or a transformation
between frames. Those definitions come from the referenced authority or from the
meta-type the schema itself supplies.

## The `tensorReferenceFrames` Keyword {#tensor-reference-frames}

The `tensorReferenceFrames` keyword identifies the reference frames on whose
axes the components of tensor quantities held in properties of an object or
tuple are resolved. A tensor quantity is a grid of numbers that means nothing
without a frame to read it against. Its rank is how many axes it takes to pick
out one number of the grid: one for a vector, two for a stress or a rotation. An
engineer checking whether a bridge beam will crack uses nine numbers because the
beam can be squeezed along its length and sheared across it at the same time, and
no single number says both.

At rank 1 the frame's declared order states the binding, which is what
`vectorReferenceFrames` ({{vector-reference-frames}}) does and why `frames`
requires at least two entries. Above rank 1 the vector model no longer suffices
and member names are insufficient. `vectorReferenceFrames` and
`tensorReferenceFrames` coexist, because vectors are common and should be easy
to declare.

When present, `tensorReferenceFrames` MUST be a non-empty array. Each element
MUST be an object with a REQUIRED `frames` array, a REQUIRED `components`
member, and an OPTIONAL `symmetry` string. No other members are permitted. The
keyword is an array because one record may carry more than one tensor quantity.

### The `frames` Property {#tensor-reference-frames-frames}

`frames` MUST be an array of at least two objects, each with REQUIRED
`reference` and `kind` members whose values are as defined for
`vectorReferenceFrames` ({{vector-reference-frames}}). The number of entries is
the rank of the tensor, and the index in position k ranges over the axes of the
frame given by entry k, in the order that frame declares.

One frame MAY be named by more than one entry, and is so named for a stress, a
strain, or a seismic moment tensor. Where the two entries of a rank-2 tensor
name different frames, the tensor carries a vector in the second frame to a
vector in the first, as for a rotation matrix or a Jacobian.

Each entry MAY carry `variance` as defined in {{variance}}, stating how the
index in that position responds to a change of the frame it ranges over. The
entries of one tensor need not agree. A stress tensor is contravariant in both
indices, while a Jacobian is contravariant in the first and covariant in the
second, which is what makes it a map between frames rather than a quantity in
one.

Three entries give a rank-3 tensor, and one frame may fill them all. The
piezoelectric strain coefficients of a crystal are one such tensor: an electric
field applied along one axis strains the crystal across every pair of axes, so
each coefficient is picked out by three axes of the same crystal frame.

`d` is nested three deep because `frames` has three entries, and each level is
indexed by the three axes of `CrystalAxes`, so it holds twenty-seven values. The
outermost index is the axis of the applied field and the two inner ones are the
axes of the strain it produces. Each level constrains its length to three
{{JSTRUCT-VALIDATION}}, which is how the shape the frames require is stated in
the schema rather than left to the instance.

`symmetry` MUST NOT be present unless `frames` has exactly two entries naming
the same frame and declaring the same `variance`, or omitting it in both, since
it speaks of an exchange of two indices ranging over one set of axes and a pair
of indices of differing variance does not survive the exchange under a change of
frame. It MUST be `symmetric`, `skewSymmetric`, or `none`, and it is
`none` where absent. Under `symmetric` the component at row i and column j
equals the component at row j and column i; under `skewSymmetric` it is the
negation of it and the diagonal is zero. The symmetries of tensors of higher
rank, such as the minor and major symmetries of an elastic stiffness tensor, are
not expressible here, and every component of such a tensor that is carried MUST
be named individually.

### The `components` Property {#tensor-reference-frames-components}

`components` MUST take one of two forms, each of which states the pairing of
index to value in the schema, and neither of which admits a layout, packing, or
multiplication convention as a separate declaration.

The first form is a string naming a direct property of the annotated object or
tuple whose type is an `array` or a `tuple` nested to exactly the depth given by
the number of entries in `frames`, the outermost level indexed by the axes of
the first entry and each further level by the next in turn, and whose innermost
items are of a numeric type. A nesting whose depth differs from the number of
entries in `frames` makes the annotation invalid. At every level, the number of
elements an instance carries MUST equal the number of axes declared by the frame
of the corresponding entry, so a `tuple`, or an `array` whose length is
constrained {{JSTRUCT-VALIDATION}}, states the shape in the schema where a bare
`array` leaves it to the instance. The nesting carries the layout, so the
row-major and column-major
question does not arise, and a tensor declared `symmetric` or `skewSymmetric` is
written out in full in this form. Every position of the tensor is carried, so
the rule of the paragraph after the next does not apply to this form.

The second form is a non-empty array of objects, each with a REQUIRED `index`
and a REQUIRED `property` and no other members. `index` MUST be an array of
non-negative integers whose length equals the number of entries in `frames`, and
whose integer in position k MUST be less than the number of axes declared by the
frame of entry k. `property` MUST name a direct property of the annotated object
or tuple having a numeric type. Every component carried states its own index, so
no packing order is defined here and the Voigt-style orderings in circulation
need not be distinguished. Within one `components` array no two entries may
carry equal `index` values, and no two entries may name the same property.

In the second form, a position named by no entry is determined by `symmetry`
where `symmetry` is `symmetric` or `skewSymmetric`, and is otherwise undeclared;
under `none` every position MUST be named. Where `symmetry` is `symmetric` or
`skewSymmetric`, at least one of each mirrored pair of positions MUST be named,
and where both are named the instance values MUST stand in the relation that
`symmetry` declares. The units of the members named by one element MUST be
mutually convertible and SHOULD be identical.

The Global CMT catalogue publishes a source solution for every significant
earthquake as a fixed-column text record, and states the frame those solutions
are resolved on only in the document describing that format: six moment-tensor
elements against a spherical frame in which r is up, t is south, and p is east
{{GCMT-NDK}}. The tensor is symmetric, so those six determine all nine, and the
second form of `components` states the index of each without appeal to a packing
order. What a reader of the text file must look up, the schema carries.

The value under `mtp` sits at row 1 and column 2, and the declaration of
`symmetric` puts the same value at row 2 and column 1. Nothing in the instance
says so: the six numbers alone determine nine components only once the schema
has stated the frame, the index of each, and the symmetry.

`UseFrame` is a local frame, and up, south, and east are directions only once a
point on the Earth is given. The point is the one the `coordinateReferenceSystem`
of the same object binds, and the `description` of the meta-type is where a
schema says so. This document defines no member that binds a frame to the
position that orients it, and a processor MUST NOT infer such a binding from the
presence of both keywords on one type.

A rank-2 quantity whose two entries name different frames is a map from one
frame to the other, and an attitude matrix, a Jacobian, and a sensor alignment
are all of that shape. `tensorReferenceFrames` describes such a quantity
correctly, but it says only what the indices range over. It does not say that
the numbers are a transformation, and it cannot describe the quaternion, the
axis and angle, or the three Euler angles that the same transformation is more
often published as. Where the annotated properties carry a transformation,
`frameTransforms` ({{frame-transforms}}) SHOULD be used instead.

## The `frameTransforms` Keyword {#frame-transforms}

The `frameTransforms` keyword identifies properties of an object or tuple that
carry a transformation from one reference frame to another.

The keywords before it bind quantities. `coordinateReferenceSystem` binds a
position, `vectorReferenceFrames` binds a direction, and `tensorReferenceFrames`
binds a quantity whose components take more than one axis index. A
transformation is none of those. It is the map between two frames, and the
numbers carrying it mean nothing until the sense of the map, the handedness of
its angles, and the arrangement of its components are all settled.

Common practice settles none of them. NASA's Navigation and Ancillary
Information Facility, which maintains the toolkit most planetary missions
navigate with, states the position plainly: "there are no standards defining
construction of quaternions, the underlying associated mathematics, or the
connection to rotations. In the absence of such standards, different
organizations adopt disparate definitions, which makes communication difficult"
{{NAIF-QUAT}}. The same paper enumerates what a reader must resolve before a
rotation can be applied: whether a positive angle turns in the right-hand sense,
whether the rotation turns a vector or turns the frame, whether the matrix
multiplies from the left or the right, whether the sense runs from the base
frame or towards it, and, for a quaternion, where the scalar sits and what sign
its multiplication rule carries. Six independent choices, of which, as that
paper observes, "the composition of several misunderstandings can lead to
correct results in one context, incorrect in another, and frustration in
general". The Robot Operating System reaches the same conclusion about Euler
angles, which it discourages "due to having 24 'valid' conventions with
different domains using different conventions by default" {{REP-103}}.

When present, `frameTransforms` MUST be a non-empty array. Each element MUST be
an object with REQUIRED `from`, `to`, `encoding`, and `components`, OPTIONAL
`rotationSequence` and `translation`, and no other members. The keyword is an
array because one record may carry more than one transformation, as an attitude
message does when it gives the orientation of a single instrument against two
different reference frames.

### The Conventions This Document Fixes {#transform-conventions}

Every frame named by `from` or `to` MUST be right-handed and MUST declare
exactly three axes, and a positive angle MUST be read as a rotation in the
right-hand sense about the axis it is stated against. Every encoding this
keyword defines presupposes three dimensions, so a frame of any other arity
cannot be named by either member.

A transformation carries coordinates expressed in the `from` frame into
coordinates expressed in the `to` frame. Writing `x` for the coordinates of a
vector in the `from` frame and `x'` for the coordinates of the same vector in
the `to` frame, the transformation is the `M` for which `x' = M x`, and
`translation`, where present, adds to that as `x' = M x + t`. This is the
frame-transformation sense rather than the vector-rotation sense: the quantity
does not move, the frame does.

The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems states that same sense for its
attitude messages. The quaternion "from frame A to frame B" is "the quaternion
of the rotation that transforms the basis vectors of frame A into the basis
vectors of frame B", and the matrix it corresponds to is defined by
`XB = MBA * XA` {{CCSDS-ADM}}.

This document fixes these choices rather than offering them as members to be
declared, and that committee is the precedent. Its first issue made both the
direction and the placement of the quaternion scalar into fields a producer
filled in, `ATTITUDE_DIR` taking `A2B` or `B2A` and `QUATERNION_TYPE` taking
`FIRST` or `LAST` {{CCSDS-ADM1}}. Its second issue deleted both, recording the
rationale as "Simplicity of the standard" and, for the wider set of changes that
pinned the meanings down, "To avoid misuse of exchange data" {{CCSDS-ADM}}.
Fixing them cost that standard the ability to carry records laid out the other
way, because its records are positional. It costs this document nothing, because
`components` names members rather than positions. A schema whose quaternion is
stored scalar-last and one whose quaternion is stored scalar-first carry the
same annotation, with the names written in the order fixed here.

### The `from` and `to` Properties {#frame-transforms-from-and-to}

`from` and `to` MUST each be an object with a REQUIRED `reference` and a
REQUIRED `kind`, whose value spaces and meanings are those they have in
`vectorReferenceFrames` ({{vector-reference-frames}}). The axes of both frames
MUST be directions rather than angles. `variance` MUST NOT appear in either,
since a frame named by a transformation is not an index position of a quantity.

`from` and `to` MAY cite the same `reference`. A transformation between two
realizations of one frame, or between one frame at two epochs, is written that
way.

### The `encoding` Property {#frame-transforms-encoding}

`encoding` states which arrangement of numbers carries the transformation. It is
a closed enumeration, and a value outside it is invalid, because each value
carries an arithmetic meaning that this document defines.

| Encoding | Carried by |
|---|---|
| `quaternion` | Four members: the scalar, then the three components of the vector part. |
| `axisAngle` | Four members: the angle, then the three components of the rotation axis. |
| `eulerAngles` | Three members: the angles of three successive intrinsic rotations. |
| `rotationMatrix` | Nine values arranged three by three. |
| `homogeneousMatrix` | Sixteen values arranged four by four, acting on augmented coordinates. |

Every encoding but the last carries a rotation and nothing else, and an offset
between the origins of the two frames is then carried by `translation`
({{transform-translation}}) or not at all. `homogeneousMatrix` carries the
rotation and the offset together in one matrix `M4`, acting on augmented
coordinates as `[x', 1] = M4 [x, 1]` written as column vectors. Its first three
rows and first three columns are the rotation `M`, its fourth column holds in
its first three entries the same three values `translation` would carry and in
its fourth entry a one, and its fourth row is three zeroes and a one.

The nine values of a `rotationMatrix`, and the first three rows and columns of a
`homogeneousMatrix`, SHOULD be orthonormal with determinant positive one, within
a tolerance appropriate to the numeric type. A processor is not required to
verify this, and this document defines no tolerance. The remaining entries of a
`homogeneousMatrix` MUST be as the previous paragraph states, so a projective
matrix, a matrix carrying a scaling or a shear, and a matrix whose fourth row is
anything other than three zeroes and a one are all outside this encoding.

The first three entries of the fourth column of a `homogeneousMatrix` carry a
length and the rest of the matrix is dimensionless, so those three entries are
subject to the same unit rule as `translation` ({{transform-translation}}): their
units MUST be mutually convertible and SHOULD be identical. A single nested
property cannot state a unit for one position and not another, so a schema
carrying a `homogeneousMatrix` in that form MUST establish those units in the
referenced definition or in the indexed form of `components`, which names a
separate property for each position.

### The `components` Property {#frame-transforms-components}

`components` names the members that carry the transformation, and its form
follows `encoding`.

For `quaternion`, `axisAngle`, and `eulerAngles`, `components` MUST be an array
of names of direct properties of the annotated object or tuple, all of numeric
type and all distinct, of the length the encoding requires. Order within that
array is fixed by this document. It is never inferred from the order in which
the properties are declared, from their names, or from their position in a
`tuple`.

For `rotationMatrix` and `homogeneousMatrix`, `components` MUST be either the
name of one property whose type is an `array` or a `tuple` nested twice, the
outer index selecting the row, or an array of indexed components in the form
`tensorReferenceFrames` uses ({{tensor-reference-frames}}), each stating its own
`index` of two non-negative integers, row first. Neither form leaves a row-major
or column-major reading open, which a flat array of nine or sixteen values
would.

In the nested form, each instance level MUST carry three elements for
`rotationMatrix` and four for `homogeneousMatrix`. In the indexed form, every
position MUST be named, nine of them for `rotationMatrix` and sixteen for
`homogeneousMatrix`, and each integer of an `index` MUST be less than three,
respectively four. `symmetry` has no counterpart here, so no position is
determined by any other and none may be left undeclared.

#### Quaternions {#quaternions}

The four names given for `quaternion` are, in order, the member carrying the
scalar and the members carrying the three components of the vector part, in
the axis order the frames declare. Writing `a` for the angle of the rotation
that carries the `from` frame into the `to` frame and `e` for its unit axis, the
scalar is `cos(a/2)` and each of the other three is `sin(a/2)` times the
corresponding component of `e`. The axis is unchanged by its own rotation, so
its components are the same in both frames and the question of which frame they
are resolved in does not arise. Which physical direction the second, third, and
fourth names stand for therefore follows from the axis order the frames declare,
not from any convention of this document.

The four values taken together SHOULD have unit norm, and the scalar SHOULD be
non-negative, which confines the rotation angle to a half turn either way
{{CCSDS-ADM1}}.

A worked case fixes the sense. Let the `to` frame be the `from` frame turned a
quarter turn in the right-hand sense about the third axis, so that the first
axis of the `to` frame has the coordinates 0, 1, 0 in the `from` frame. The
quaternion is then the scalar 0.7071 with axis components 0, 0, 0.7071, and a
vector whose coordinates in the `from` frame are 1, 0, 0 has the coordinates 0,
-1, 0 in the `to` frame. Those are the values {{CCSDS-ADM}} prints for the same
case.

One other convention is in wide enough use to name. The SPICE toolkit places
the scalar first, as this document does, and measures its angle as the
rotation of the coordinate system from the base frame in the right-hand sense,
as this document does. It nevertheless carries the negation of the vector part
this document carries, so for the case above it gives the scalar 0.7071 with
vector components 0, 0, -0.7071. The cause is not the parameterization but the
multiplication rule: NAIF records that its own product takes the cross-product
term positive where the other convention in circulation takes it negative, that
this "has the effect of inverting the sense of the rotation", and that
converting a quaternion of the other convention into a SPICE one is done by
moving the scalar to the front and negating the remaining three {{NAIF-QUAT}}.
The two therefore differ in the sign of the vector part while agreeing on
everything a reader is likely to check, and nothing in the four numbers reveals
which was meant. That is the ambiguity this keyword removes.

The example below annotates an attitude carried as four separate properties. The
record stores the scalar last, as the current attitude message standard requires
of its own records, and `components` names it first, as this document requires
of the annotation.

#### Axis and Angle {#axis-and-angle}

The four names given for `axisAngle` are, in order, the member carrying the
angle and the members carrying the three components of the axis. The angle is
that of the rotation carrying the `from` frame into the `to` frame, measured in
the right-hand sense about the axis, and the axis components SHOULD have unit
norm. This is the one rotation-only encoding whose members do not all carry one
unit: the angle MUST carry a `unit` or `ucumUnit` annotation of angle through
{{JSTRUCT-UNITS}}, since radians and degrees are not distinguishable in the
value, and the axis components carry none. `homogeneousMatrix` likewise mixes
units, its rotation entries carrying none and its offset entries carrying a
length.

#### Euler Angles {#euler-angles}

`eulerAngles` requires `rotationSequence`, and the three names in `components`
are the angles of the first, second, and third rotation in the order that
sequence gives.

The rotations are intrinsic. The first turns the `from` frame about the axis the
first letter names, the second turns the frame the first produced about the axis
the second letter names, and the third turns the frame the second produced, the
result being the `to` frame. Under the extrinsic reading, where every rotation
is about an axis of the original frame, the same three angles against the same
sequence describe a different transformation. Nothing is lost by fixing the
intrinsic reading, because every extrinsic sequence has an intrinsic equal that
{{rotation-sequence}} gives; degenerate cases, such as all three angles being
zero, agree under both readings and need no conversion.

That this needs saying is shown by the standard that most needs it. The current
attitude message standard states the composition is intrinsic exactly once, in
an annex marked informative {{CCSDS-ADM}}, and the issue that preceded it for
sixteen years never stated it at all {{CCSDS-ADM1}}.

### The `rotationSequence` Property {#rotation-sequence}

`rotationSequence` MUST be present when `encoding` is `eulerAngles` and MUST NOT
be present otherwise. Its value MUST be three characters drawn from `X`, `Y`,
and `Z`, no two adjacent characters being equal, which admits twelve values:
`XYX`, `XYZ`, `XZX`, `XZY`, `YXY`, `YXZ`, `YZX`, `YZY`, `ZXY`, `ZXZ`, `ZYX`, and
`ZYZ`. The value is case-sensitive, and only these twelve upper-case strings are
valid. The leftmost character names the axis of the first rotation.

`X` names the first axis of the frame being turned, `Y` the second, and `Z` the
third, in the order that frame declares its axes. The letters are positional and
carry no direction of their own, whatever the frame calls its axes: in a frame
declaring north, east, and down, `X` is north, `Y` is east, and `Z` is down.

Twelve values are enough for every rotation, including every rotation a source
states extrinsically, and an annotator working from such a source converts
rather than looks for a value that is not there. A rotation stated extrinsically
as a sequence of three axes with three angles is the same rotation as the
intrinsic sequence whose axis letters are those three in reverse, taking the same
three angle values in reverse order. Both reverse. Reversing the letters while
leaving the angles in place, or the reverse of that, gives a different rotation,
and is the error this paragraph exists to prevent.

The twelve conversions are these. In every row the angles reverse, so
`components` names the member holding the source's third angle first and the
member holding its first angle last.

| Extrinsic sequence | rotationSequence value | components order |
|---|---|---|
| `XYX` | `XYX` | third, second, first |
| `XYZ` | `ZYX` | third, second, first |
| `XZX` | `XZX` | third, second, first |
| `XZY` | `YZX` | third, second, first |
| `YXY` | `YXY` | third, second, first |
| `YXZ` | `ZXY` | third, second, first |
| `YZX` | `XZY` | third, second, first |
| `YZY` | `YZY` | third, second, first |
| `ZXY` | `YXZ` | third, second, first |
| `ZXZ` | `ZXZ` | third, second, first |
| `ZYX` | `XYZ` | third, second, first |
| `ZYZ` | `ZYZ` | third, second, first |

The six sequences whose first and third letters are equal reverse to themselves,
and those rows are the ones to read carefully: the value written is the same
string the source gives, which makes it easy to conclude that nothing needs
doing. Something does. The angles still reverse, and an extrinsic `ZXZ` recorded
as an intrinsic `ZXZ` with the angles left in source order is a different
rotation from the one the source states.

A source giving an extrinsic X-then-Y-then-Z rotation of 10, 20, and 30 degrees
is therefore annotated with a `rotationSequence` of `ZYX`, and `components`
naming the member holding 30 degrees first, then the member holding 20, then the
member holding 10. The members themselves do not move and their values are not
rewritten; only the order in which `components` names them changes. Because
nothing in the annotation records that the source was extrinsic, a schema that
converts SHOULD say so in `description`, so that a later reader comparing the
schema against the source document does not read the reversal as a mistake.
An extrinsic reading MUST NOT be recorded by inventing a thirteenth value, a
lower-case spelling, or any other marking.

The six values whose first and third characters are equal are permitted, though
the standard that first enumerated them discouraged them "as their use can cause
confusion" {{CCSDS-ADM1}}.

### The `translation` Property {#transform-translation}

`translation`, when present, MUST be an array of exactly three names of direct
properties of the annotated object or tuple, all of numeric type and all
distinct, giving the coordinates of the origin of the `from` frame expressed in
the `to` frame, on the axes of the `to` frame in the order that frame declares
them. That is the `t` of `x' = M x + t` ({{transform-conventions}}), and it is
the offset from the origin of the `to` frame to the origin of the `from` frame,
not the other way about. Their units MUST be mutually convertible and SHOULD be
identical.

`translation` MUST NOT be present when `encoding` is `homogeneousMatrix`, whose
fourth column carries the same three values in the same sense. Where
`translation` is absent and `encoding` is not `homogeneousMatrix`, the element
declares a rotation and says nothing about the origins, which is the correct
reading for an attitude and the wrong one for a sensor alignment.

The KITTI dataset publishes the alignment between its laser scanner and its
reference camera in a calibration file holding nine numbers on one line and
three on another, and states in its paper that the rotation and the translation
run from the laser to the camera {{KITTI}}. Neither the file nor the paper says
whether
the nine numbers are rows or columns; the developer kit for one of its
benchmarks states that its matrices are stored row-major, and the raw
calibration file carries no such statement. The two readings are transposes of
one another, and for a rotation matrix both are valid rotations, so nothing in
the numbers rules either out. Only the physical arrangement of the sensors does.
The schema below states the reading, and the axis directions the file leaves to
the reader, as declarations.

Read as rows, the first inner array gives the first axis of the camera frame in
the components of the laser frame, and the matrix maps the forward axis of the
laser onto the optical axis of the camera, which is the arrangement the vehicle
has. Read as columns, it maps them the other way. The file name carries the
direction and nothing carries the layout, which is the division of labor this
keyword ends.

## The `linearReferenceSystem` Keyword {#linear-reference-systems}

The `linearReferenceSystem` keyword identifies the linear reference system
{{ISO19148}} under which a location held in properties of an object or tuple is
to be interpreted.

When present, `linearReferenceSystem` MUST be an object with REQUIRED
`reference`, `kind`, `linearElement`, and `measure` strings and OPTIONAL
`measureEnd` and `direction` strings. No other properties are permitted.

### The `reference` Property {#linear-reference-systems-reference}

`reference` MUST identify one linear reference system. Where `kind` is `type` it
MUST be a type reference `{ "$ref": <JSON Pointer> }` {{JSTRUCT-CORE}} to a
shareable type
definition, and otherwise it MUST be an absolute URI {{RFC3986}}. The identified
definition MUST establish the linear referencing method, the measure origin, the
increasing-measure direction, the measure unit, and the linear-element
namespace. `kind` states which definition model the reference identifies.

A processor is not required to dereference the URI. This
document does not define a resolution protocol, URI layout, storage model, or
definition serialization.

### The `kind` Property {#linear-reference-systems-kind}

`kind` classifies which definition model the URI identifies. It is an open
enumeration. The following values are defined here:

| Kind | Referenced definition |
|---|---|
| `lrs-network` | A network published by a geospatial feature service whose layer and metadata resources establish the linear elements and the measure, such as the WSDOT State Route system {{WSDOT-LRS}}. |
| `type` | A meta-type declaring members whose `referenceRole` is `linearElement` and `measure`, and optionally `direction` ({{meta-types}}). |

Other values MAY name further definition models. {{reference-uris}} discusses
the availability of registered definitions.

Since the identified definition MUST establish the measure unit, the
increasing-measure direction, and the linear-element namespace, a feature
service layer that carries measure values on its vertices and a route
identifier field without stating those is a rendering of positions in a
reference system rather than a definition of one, and it does not qualify as an
`lrs-network`.

A `type` reference carries a system that no authority publishes, such as one
internal to a plant, a terminal, or a private network. The referenced meta-type
MUST declare a member whose `referenceRole` is `linearElement` and a member
whose `referenceRole` is `measure`, and MAY declare one whose `referenceRole` is
`direction`. The `linearElement`, `measure`, and `direction` properties of the
annotation map the annotated properties onto those members, so the type of the
element identifier and the unit of the measure are checkable. Where the
annotation names a `measureEnd`, that property maps onto the same member of the
meta-type as `measure`, because both carry a distance in the same system. The
referencing method, measure origin, increasing-measure direction, and
linear-element namespace are stated in the `description` of the meta-type or of
its members.

### The `linearElement` Property {#linear-reference-systems-linear-element}

`linearElement` MUST name a direct property of the annotated object or tuple.
The property value identifies the road, railway, waterway, route, or other
linear element within the linear-element namespace established by the
identified system.

### The `measure` Property {#linear-reference-systems-measure}

`measure` MUST name a direct numeric property, distinct from `linearElement`.
The property gives the
distance from the measure origin along the identified linear element. It MUST
have a `unit` or `ucumUnit` annotation compatible with the measure unit
established by the identified system.

### The `measureEnd` Property {#linear-reference-systems-measure-end}

`measureEnd`, when present, MUST name another distinct direct numeric property
whose type and unit are those required of `measure`.

Where `measureEnd` is absent, the annotation locates a point on the linear
element at `measure`. Where it is present, the annotation locates the span of
that element between `measure` and `measureEnd`, and `measure` is the start of
the span. Both ends lie on the one element that `linearElement` identifies, and
this document defines no span crossing two elements.

The span is closed at both ends, which differs from the half-open convention
this document uses for temporal intervals. Two spans that share an end therefore
share the point at that end, and a consumer counting over abutting sections MUST
account for that shared point. A span whose ends are equal is the point at that
measure. This
document does not require that `measureEnd` exceed `measure`, since a system
whose increasing-measure direction opposes the direction of travel encodes a
forward span with a decreasing pair.

### The `direction` Property {#linear-reference-systems-direction}

`direction`, when present, MUST name another distinct direct property. Its
value qualifies the direction of travel or orientation using the vocabulary
established by the identified system. It does not alter the increasing-measure
direction.

Properties not named by `linearElement`, `measure`, `measureEnd`, or `direction`
are not part of the linearly referenced location.

This binding describes a location along one identified linear element, either a
point or a span. This document does not define offsets, referent-relative
addressing, interpolative methods, transformations between linear reference
systems, or network topology.

The following excerpt locates a point on a Washington State route, where `arm`
is the accumulated route mile measured from the route origin. The cited service
qualifies as an `lrs-network` because the layer it names publishes the route
identifier syntax and the increasing-measure direction in its own metadata
rather than leaving them to a reader of the geometry: it decomposes the route
identifier into its parts and states that "a directional indicator has been added
to the RouteIdentifier to distinguish between the increasing and decreasing
direction of mileposting" {{WSDOT-LRS}}. It does not state the unit of the
measure values, which is why the `measure` rule requires the annotated property
to carry one:

# Colorimetric Reference Annotations {#colorimetric-reference-annotations}

Color is the worked instance of a larger family: components resolved onto the
channels of a named space, where the space fixes the basis those numbers weigh,
the reference they stand relative to, and the encoding they carry.
{{spatial-reference-annotations}} gives that treatment to positions and
directions, and this section gives it to color, because color is the perceptual
signal most often carried in general-purpose JSON — design tokens, stylesheets,
image metadata — and the one most often carried with all of that left silent.
The same family continues past color in {{signal-channel-annotations}}, where
audio channel layout and multiband imaging resolve channel numbers onto a named
space as color does. A coded value bound to an external list
({{coded-value-annotations}}) and the weighting a scalar measurement carries
({{measurement-conditioning}}) are relatives of a different shape, each treated
in its own section.

## The `colorSpaces` Keyword {#color-spaces}

The `colorSpaces` keyword identifies the color spaces in which channel values
held in properties of an object or tuple are to be interpreted.

A color value is a measurement. Three numbers are not a
color until something states which primaries they weigh, what white they are
relative to, what range they run over, and whether they are proportional to
light or to the signal that drives a display. Most of those are almost never
carried with the numbers, and the ones that are are carried by conventions that
differ between formats.

The keywords of {{spatial-reference-annotations}} lean on registers. A
position has the EPSG dataset and the OGC definitions server behind it, and a
schema names a system by a URI that resolves to a definition of it. Color has no
equivalent. The International Color Consortium publishes registries of RGB color
spaces and of print characterization data, but those are pages written for a
reader rather than identifiers minted for a machine {{ICC-REGISTRY}}. What
exists in place of a register is of two other sorts. A standards document may
assign a code point, as {{ITU-H273}} assigns combinations of primaries, transfer
function, matrix coefficients, and signal range to four integers. Or the
definition travels with the data as a profile, identified by a checksum over its
own contents {{ICC-SPEC}}. Neither is a URI and neither dereferences. A
`reference` in this keyword identifies more often than it resolves, which is
true of the other reference-style keywords as well but is true of this one
always.

When present, `colorSpaces` MUST be a non-empty array. Each element MUST be an
object with REQUIRED `reference`, `kind`, and `channels`, OPTIONAL `codePoints`,
`packing`, `alpha`, `alphaMode`, `transfer`, `illuminant`, and `observer`, and no
other members. The keyword is an array because one record may carry a color in more
than one space, as a characterization dataset does when it gives the device
values that were printed alongside the color that was measured off the result.

These members can disagree, and one principle settles every case in which they
do. `reference` identifies a definition that describes a class of data, while
`codePoints`, `transfer`, `illuminant`, and `observer` state what is true of
*this* data. The narrower statement prevails, because a schema author declaring
one is recording a fact about the values in hand and a definition cannot be. The
specific rules follow from that and are stated where each member is defined
({{color-code-points}}, {{color-transfer}}, {{color-illuminant-observer}}); no
rule lets a definition override a member, and none of them makes a schema
invalid, since a processor that cannot resolve the definition cannot detect the
disagreement in the first place.

### The `reference` and `kind` Properties {#color-spaces-reference-and-kind}

`reference` MUST identify one color space or one set of device control values.
Where `kind` is `type` it MUST be a type reference `{ "$ref": <JSON Pointer> }`
{{JSTRUCT-CORE}} to a shareable type definition. Where `kind` is `icc-profile` it MUST be a URI
{{RFC3986}} identifying the profile; the profile identifier {{ICC-SPEC}}
computes over the profile contents is not itself a URI, and a schema carrying
only that identifier MUST express it as one, under a scheme of the schema
author's choosing that states which digest the remainder is. Otherwise it MUST
be an absolute URI {{RFC3986}}.

What the identified definition MUST establish follows from what is being
identified.

| Identified | What the definition establishes |
|---|---|
| A space whose channels are additive primaries | The primaries, the white point, and the transfer function. |
| A space whose channels are tristimulus quantities, or are computed from them | The reference white, and the illuminant and the standard colorimetric observer, or else the schema declares them under `illuminant` and `observer`. |
| A set of device control values | The device, medium, and process the values drive, and the measurement conditions under which the result was characterized. |

A set of device control values is not a color space in the colorimetric sense,
and the third row exists because such values are carried alongside colors often
enough that excluding them would push the commonest characterization record out
of this keyword. `channels`, `alpha`, and `alphaMode` apply to it unchanged;
`codePoints`, `transfer`, `illuminant`, and `observer` do not, and MUST NOT be
present on an element identifying one.

`kind` classifies which definition model the reference identifies. It is an open
enumeration. The following values are defined here:

| Kind | Referenced definition |
|---|---|
| `itu` | A Recommendation of the International Telecommunication Union. |
| `iec` | A standard of the International Electrotechnical Commission. |
| `cie` | A publication of the International Commission on Illumination {{CIE015}}. |
| `icc-profile` | An ICC profile, identified as {{ICC-SPEC}} identifies one. |
| `icc-registry` | An entry in a registry the International Color Consortium publishes {{ICC-REGISTRY}}. |
| `type` | A meta-type in the annotated schema, as {{meta-types}} describes. |

A processor is not required to dereference the URI. This document does not
define a resolution protocol, URI layout, storage model, or definition
serialization. Where an element carries `codePoints`, `transfer`, `illuminant`,
or `observer` alongside `reference`, those members prevail over the identified
definition where the two disagree ({{color-code-points}}, {{color-transfer}},
{{color-illuminant-observer}}).

### The `codePoints` Property {#color-code-points}

`codePoints`, when present, MUST be an array of exactly four non-negative
integers, being the color primaries, transfer characteristics, matrix
coefficients, and video full range flag that {{ITU-H273}} defines, in that
order.

These four integers are the only identifier of a color space that is both
machine-readable and widely deployed. The PNG specification carries the same
four in a chunk of its own, gives that chunk precedence over every other color
declaration a file may hold, and requires the chunk carrying mastering display
metadata to be accompanied by it, on the ground that such metadata means nothing
without the space it is relative to {{PNG3}}. Where the identified definition
and the code points disagree, the code points are the narrower statement and a
processor MUST prefer them, so that two processors reading one schema do not
part company. `transfer` is narrower still: where `transfer` is `linear`, it
overrides the transfer characteristics code point, and where `transfer` is
`asDefined` or absent, that code point governs.

### The `channels` Property {#color-spaces-channels}

`channels` MUST be a non-empty array of names of direct properties of the
annotated object or tuple, all distinct, mapped by position onto the channels of
the space in the order the identified definition declares them. Except where
`packing` is present, the number of channels supplied MUST equal the number the
identified space defines, and an opacity channel is not one of them. As with
`coordinates` and `components`, the ordering is an assertion by the schema author
and is never inferred from property order, property names, or position in a
`tuple`.

Where `packing` is absent, either every name is that of a property of numeric
type, or the array holds exactly one name, that of a property whose type is
`array` or `tuple` and whose elements are of numeric type, in which case the
elements of that property supply the channels in order. Where `packing` is
present, the array holds exactly one name, that of a property of type `string`,
and the channels are read out of that one value as {{packing}} states.

This document does not fix the range or the unit of a channel value. Where the
identified definition does not establish them, as it does not for a device
control value, the schema SHOULD declare them, by a `unit` annotation, by a
numeric range, or in the `description` of the property. The channels of one
element SHOULD share one range convention. A `packing` establishes both, and a
schema carrying one declares neither.

### The `packing` Property {#packing}

A color is often carried not as a set of numbers but as one string that has all
of them inside it. The hexadecimal notation is the commonest such string in the
world, and it asserts four things at once that the numbers alone do not: that the
order is red, green, blue; that each channel is eight bits; that the range runs
from zero to two hundred and fifty-five; and, in the CSS reading, that the space
is sRGB with its transfer function applied. A reader who knows the convention
supplies all four. This keyword exists so that they need not be known.

`packing`, when present, states that one string property carries every channel of
the element. Its value MUST be `hexRgb` or `hexRgba`.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `hexRgb` | Three channels in three or six hexadecimal digits. |
| `hexRgba` | Three channels and an opacity in four or eight hexadecimal digits. |

The value of the named property MUST consist of hexadecimal digits, optionally
preceded by a single `#`, and MUST hold three or six digits under `hexRgb` and
four or eight under `hexRgba`. The letters are case-insensitive, as {{CSS-COLOR-4}}
says in as many words: "the case of the letters doesn't matter - `#00ff00` is
identical to `#00FF00`". The `#` is part of the CSS token rather than of the
notation, and a schema requiring one form or forbidding the other states so by a
`pattern` {{JSTRUCT-VALIDATION}}; CSS itself accepts the bare form under the
quirks mode of {{CSS-COLOR-4}}.

In the six-digit and eight-digit forms each successive pair of digits is one
channel, read as an integer from zero to two hundred and fifty-five, where zero is
the minimum of that channel and two hundred and fifty-five is its maximum. In the
three-digit and four-digit forms each single digit stands for the pair obtained by
writing it twice, so that `#123` is `#112233`. The order is fixed by this document
and is red, green, blue, and, under `hexRgba`, opacity. It is not taken from the
order the identified definition declares, and an element whose identified space
declares its channels in any other order MUST NOT use a `packing`.

The identified space MUST define exactly three channels, and they MUST be
additive primaries. `alpha` MUST NOT be present where `packing` is `hexRgba`,
whose fourth channel is the opacity; `alphaMode` MAY be present there and applies
to it. `alpha` MAY be present where `packing` is `hexRgb`, which carries none.

A packing carries eight bits for each channel, which is not enough resolution for
values proportional to light, so `transfer` SHOULD be `asDefined` or absent where
`packing` is present.

The space is still named by `reference`, and this document does not assume one. A
bare hexadecimal string in a document that says nothing further is sRGB only
because CSS says so, and CSS says so of the CSS notation and not of the digits:
hex colors are among those that "resolve to sRGB" {{CSS-COLOR-4}}. A record
carrying the same six digits for a wide-gamut display means a different color, and
the difference is invisible in the value.

The following excerpt is a design token whose color is written the way a
stylesheet would write it.

    }

}

### The `alpha` and `alphaMode` Properties {#color-spaces-alpha-and-alpha-mode}

`alpha`, when present, MUST name a direct property of numeric type carrying
opacity, distinct from every name in `channels`. Its value is a dimensionless
fraction from zero to one unless the property declares otherwise by a `unit`
annotation or a numeric range, and where it declares otherwise a processor MUST
reduce it to that fraction before applying `alphaMode`. `alphaMode` MUST NOT be
present when both `alpha` is absent and `packing` is not `hexRgba`, and states how
the channel values stand to the opacity, wherever that opacity is carried. When
present, its value MUST be `straight` or `premultiplied`.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `straight` | The channel values are independent of the opacity value. |
| `premultiplied` | The channel values have already been multiplied by the opacity value. |

Where an opacity is carried and `alphaMode` is absent, the value is `straight`.
That is also the reading a packed hexadecimal opacity carries on its own, since
the notation of {{CSS-COLOR-4}} does not premultiply.

The two are not distinguishable by inspection, except at an opacity of zero,
where the premultiplied channels are all zero and the color is gone. The PNG
specification states its own choice in as many words: "The color values in a
pixel are not premultiplied by the alpha value assigned to the pixel. This rule
is sometimes called 'unassociated' or 'non-premultiplied' alpha", and, flatly,
"PNG does not use premultiplied alpha" {{PNG3}}. Formats that do premultiply
exist, and values carried from one to the other without the conversion are wrong
everywhere the opacity is neither zero nor one.

### The `transfer` Property {#color-transfer}

`transfer`, when present, states whether the channel values carry the transfer
function of the identified space or are proportional to light. Its value MUST be
`asDefined` or `linear`.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `asDefined` | The values carry the transfer function the identified definition establishes. |
| `linear` | The values are proportional to radiometric quantity, taking the primaries and white point of the identified space but not its transfer function. |

When absent, the value is `asDefined`.

`linear` is what a renderer means when it calls a color energy-linear. A space
and its linear counterpart are commonly given the same name, and the two are far
apart: under the transfer function the ICC registry publishes for sRGB, a
channel value of 0.5 stands for approximately 0.214 of the light that a channel
value of 1.0 stands for {{ICC-REGISTRY}}. Arithmetic on color is defined
on the linear values, and the PNG specification requires compositing to be
performed on "intensity samples (not gamma-encoded samples)" {{PNG3}}.

### The `illuminant` and `observer` Properties {#color-illuminant-observer}

`illuminant` and `observer`, when present, state the conditions the values are
relative to. `illuminant` names a standard illuminant, and SHOULD use a
designation of {{CIE015}}. `observer` names a standard colorimetric observer; it
is an open enumeration, and the values defined here are `cie-1931-2` for the
1931 standard colorimetric observer and `cie-1964-10` for the 1964
supplementary standard colorimetric observer.

A space whose values are tristimulus quantities, or are computed from them,
does not by itself establish either. The definition of the 1976 L\*a\*b\* space
says as much: it "is applicable to tristimulus values calculated using
colour-matching functions of the CIE 1931 standard colorimetric system or the
CIE 1964 standard colorimetric system" {{ISO11664-4}}. Values computed under the
two observers from one sample differ, and nothing in the values records which
was used. Where the identified definition does not establish the illuminant and
the observer, a schema SHOULD declare `illuminant` and `observer`. Where the
definition does establish them and the declared members disagree with it, the
declared members prevail and a processor MUST prefer them, for the reason that
the schema author is stating the condition these values were computed under and
the definition is stating the condition its class of values is customarily
computed under. A processor SHOULD report the disagreement, and MUST NOT treat
it as making the schema invalid.

Published measurement data shows both practices. The characterization datasets
of the International Color Consortium carry their conditions in the file itself.
One widely used print dataset opens by stating its instrument geometry as "D50,
2 degree, geometry 45/0, no polarisation filter, white backing, according to ISO
13655:2009 M1", then repeats the illuminant and the observer angle in fields of
their own and records the national laboratory its measurements are traceable to
{{ICC-REGISTRY}}. Reference data for a widely used color target, published by
the maker of that target, states the measurement condition and the filter and
names neither an illuminant nor an observer anywhere in the file. The second is
not usable as reference data without information from outside it, and a schema
is a place to put that information.

An identifier of a color space is also an identifier of an edition of it. The
reference values for that same color target were revised, and for the white
patch alone the lightness moved by more than one unit and the yellow-blue
coordinate by nearly two, under an unchanged product name. A schema naming the
space but not the edition describes two different sets of numbers.

### Example {#color-spaces-example}

A characterization dataset pairs the device values that were sent to a press
with the color that was measured off the printed result. The two are in
different spaces, which is why the keyword is an array, and only one of them is
a color space in the colorimetric sense at all; the other is a set of device
control values whose meaning is precisely the measurement it is paired with.

The three measured values are a position in a space that is undefined until the
illuminant and the observer are known, and the file the numbers came from is one
of the ones that says so. The annotation carries what that file carries, in a
place a processor can read.

# Signal Channel Annotations {#signal-channel-annotations}

The keywords of this section resolve components onto the channels of a named
space, as {{colorimetric-reference-annotations}} does for color. A signal is
a bundle of channel numbers that means nothing until something states which
channel is which, what the numbers stand relative to, and how they are encoded.
Color carries that in `colorSpaces`; audio and multiband imaging carry it here.

## The `audioChannels` Keyword {#audio-channels}

The `audioChannels` keyword identifies the channel layout in which audio sample
values held in properties of an object or tuple are to be interpreted, the level
the samples are relative to, and the encoding they carry.

An audio sample is a measurement of a signal, and a set of samples is not sound
until something states which loudspeaker or which role each channel drives, what
the numbers stand relative to, and whether they are amplitudes or a companded
encoding of them. A bare array carries none of that, and the conventions that
carry it differ between formats.

When present, `audioChannels` MUST be a non-empty array. Each element MUST be an
object with a REQUIRED `reference`, a REQUIRED `kind`, a REQUIRED `channels`, an
OPTIONAL `levelReference`, and an OPTIONAL `encoding`, and no other members. The
keyword is an array because one record may carry more than one channel group, as
a programme does when a commentary track accompanies a music-and-effects mix.

### The `reference` and `kind` Properties {#audio-channels-reference-and-kind}

`reference` MUST identify one channel layout whose definition establishes an
ordered set of channels, each with a loudspeaker position or a role. Where
`kind` is `type` it MUST be a type reference `{ "$ref": <JSON Pointer> }`
{{JSTRUCT-CORE}} to a shareable type definition, and otherwise it MUST be an
absolute URI {{RFC3986}}.
`kind` classifies which definition model the reference identifies. It is an open
enumeration; the following values are defined here:

| Kind | Referenced definition |
|---|---|
| `itu` | A Recommendation of the International Telecommunication Union, such as the loudspeaker configurations of {{ITU-BS2051}}. |
| `type` | A meta-type in the annotated schema, as {{meta-types}} describes. |

A layout recommendation such as {{ITU-BS2051}} defines several configurations,
and a bare reference to it names the recommendation rather than one of them; a
schema that must pin one configuration deep-links to it or carries it as a
`type`. Where the recommendation mints no per-configuration URI, the deep link is
a fragment that names the configuration in the recommendation's own notation, as
`#0+5+0` names its five-loudspeaker system with a low-frequency-effects channel;
the fragment identifies the configuration whether or not the recommendation
serves it. A processor is not required to dereference the URI. This document does
not define a resolution protocol, URI layout, storage model, or definition
serialization.

### The `channels` Property {#audio-channels-channels}

`channels` MUST be a non-empty array of names of direct properties of the
annotated object or tuple, all distinct, mapped by position onto the channels of
the layout in the order the identified definition declares them. The number of
channels supplied MUST equal the number the identified layout defines. As with
`coordinates` and the channels of `colorSpaces`, the ordering is an assertion by
the schema author and is never inferred from property order, property names, or
position in a `tuple`. A low-frequency-effects channel is one of the channels,
in the position the layout assigns it, and is not inferred from a property name.
Either every name is that of a property of numeric type, or the array holds
exactly one name, that of a property whose type is `array` or `tuple` and whose
elements are of numeric type, in which case the elements of that property supply
the channels in order.

### The `levelReference` Property {#audio-level-reference}

`levelReference`, when present, states what the sample amplitudes are relative
to. Its values, their meanings, and its openness are those of the
`levelReference` of `measurementConditioning` ({{level-reference}}), which
defines them. Under `fullScale` the numeric range of the samples is stated by
the property carrying them and not by this value.

The default differs from that of `measurementConditioning`. Here, absence means
`fullScale`, because digital audio samples are referred to full scale unless
something says otherwise. Under `measurementConditioning`, absence means that no
level reference is stated, because a conditioned measurement has no comparable
default.

Programme loudness is not a
per-sample reference: it is an integrated, gated, frequency-weighted measure of
a whole programme, defined by {{ITU-BS1770}} and given a target by
{{EBU-R128}}, and a schema that carries it carries it as its own annotated
value, not as the level reference of the channels.

### The `encoding` Property {#audio-channels-encoding}

`encoding`, when present, states how the stored numbers stand to amplitude. Its
value MUST be one of the values below or an absolute URI identifying another
encoding.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `linear` | The numbers are proportional to amplitude, and full scale is the range the annotated member's declared type permits. |
| `float` | The numbers are proportional to amplitude and full scale is unit magnitude, so a sample of `1.0` is at full scale. A magnitude greater than one is legal and is a level above full scale. |
| `aLaw` | Each channel value is the eight-bit A-law code word that {{ITU-G711}} defines. |
| `muLaw` | Each channel value is the eight-bit mu-law code word that {{ITU-G711}} defines. |

Where absent, the encoding is `linear`.

The division between `linear` and `float` is the scale, not the storage type. A
member of floating-point type whose samples run to the range of an integer
quantization is `linear`; a member whose samples are normalized to unit
magnitude is `float`, whatever its declared type. The distinction matters
because every value validates under either and only one of them makes a
decibel level or a sum of channels come out right, and because a `float`
member may legitimately carry a magnitude greater than one that a reader
must not treat as an error.

Under `aLaw` or `muLaw` each channel value is
an integer from zero to two hundred and fifty-five, and a
reader restores amplitude by the inverse companding before any arithmetic.

The enumeration is open because a sample encoding is a definition maintained
elsewhere, as G.711 companding is. A value that is a URI SHOULD identify a
definition of the encoding. A processor that does not know a value MUST
preserve it, MUST NOT reject the schema for carrying it, and MUST NOT assume
that the numbers are proportional to amplitude; the check is indeterminate
rather than incorrect. A compressed bitstream is not a set of channel members
and is outside this keyword whatever its encoding is called.

Object-based and scene-based audio, in which a sample is not one loudspeaker,
are not channel layouts in this sense; they are described by the Audio
Definition Model {{ITU-BS2076}} and are outside this keyword. The time axis of
audio, the sample rate, is a regular temporal cadence and is carried by
`temporalReferenceSystem` and `cadence` ({{cadence}}), not here.

### Example {#audio-channels-example}

The record below is one multichannel sample frame of a five-channel-with-LFE
programme, whose layout is the 0+5+0 system of {{ITU-BS2051}}. The six property
names are the schema author's; the order of `channels` is what binds them to the
layout.

## The `spectralBands` Keyword {#spectral-bands}

The `spectralBands` keyword identifies the spectral bands onto which the
components of a multiband value held in properties of an object or tuple are
resolved, in the order a named sensor or band set declares them.

A multiband pixel is a row of numbers, one per band, and it means nothing until
something states which wavelengths each band covers and what physical quantity
the number is. The bands of one sensor are not the bands of another even where
they are given the same colour name, and a raw count is not a radiance until the
sensor's calibration is applied.

When present, `spectralBands` MUST be a non-empty array. Each element MUST be an
object with a REQUIRED `reference`, a REQUIRED `kind`, a REQUIRED `bands`, and an
OPTIONAL `calibration`, and no other members. The keyword is an array because one
record may resolve its components onto more than one band set, as a fused product
does when it carries bands from two instruments.

### The `reference` and `kind` Properties {#spectral-bands-reference-and-kind}

`reference` MUST identify one band set whose definition establishes an ordered
set of bands, each with a wavelength range. Where `kind` is `type` it MUST be a
type reference `{ "$ref": <JSON Pointer> }` {{JSTRUCT-CORE}} to a shareable type
definition, and
otherwise it MUST be an absolute URI {{RFC3986}}. `kind` classifies which
definition model the reference identifies. It is an open enumeration; the
following values are defined here:

| Kind | Referenced definition |
|---|---|
| `sensor` | A band set published by the operator of an instrument, such as the Operational Land Imager bands of {{USGS-LANDSAT}}. |
| `type` | A meta-type in the annotated schema, as {{meta-types}} describes. |

A publication that lists the band sets of several instruments names one of them
by a deep link, a fragment naming the instrument where the publisher mints no
per-instrument URI, as `#landsat-8-9-oli` names the Operational Land Imager; the
fragment identifies the band set whether or not the publication serves it. A
processor is not required to dereference the URI. This document does not
define a resolution protocol, URI layout, storage model, or definition
serialization.

### The `bands` Property {#spectral-bands-bands}

`bands` MUST be a non-empty array of names of direct properties of the annotated
object or tuple, all distinct, mapped by position onto the bands of the set in
the order the identified definition declares them. The number of bands supplied
MUST equal the number the identified set defines. As with the channels of
`colorSpaces`, the ordering is an assertion by the schema author and is never
inferred from property order, property names, or position in a `tuple`. Either
every name is that of a property of numeric type, or the array holds exactly one
name, that of a property whose type is `array` or `tuple` and whose elements are
of numeric type, in which case the elements of that property supply the bands in
order.

### The `calibration` Property {#spectral-bands-calibration}

`calibration`, when present, states what physical quantity each band value is.
It is an open enumeration; the values defined here are:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `digitalNumber` | The values are quantized, calibrated, scaled digital numbers in the identified product encoding, which become a physical quantity only when the per-band coefficients of the acquisition are applied. |
| `radiance` | The values are spectral radiance, and their unit is stated by JSON Structure Units {{JSTRUCT-UNITS}}. |
| `reflectance` | The values are reflectance, a dimensionless fraction, of the kind the identified product defines, such as top-of-atmosphere planetary reflectance with or without a solar-angle correction; where they are stored scaled, the property states the scale. |

Where absent, the calibration is not established by this annotation and the
identified definition or the unit of the property governs. The rescaling from a
digital number to radiance or reflectance is per-band; for the Landsat imagers
it is a multiplicative and an additive coefficient for each band, delivered in
the product metadata {{USGS-LANDSAT-L1}}, and a schema that holds digital numbers
holds those coefficients as their own values. A quantity the values defined here
do not name, such as brightness temperature, is carried as an open value.

### Example {#spectral-bands-example}

The record below is one pixel of a nine-band Operational Land Imager scene,
whose bands are those of {{USGS-LANDSAT}}, carried as reflectance.

# Conformance {#conformance}

## Check Outcomes {#check-outcomes}

A check defined by this document has one of three outcomes. It is valid when a
processor evaluated it and it held, invalid when a processor evaluated it and it
did not hold, and indeterminate when a processor did not evaluate it because a
definition it depends on was not resolved.

A processor MUST report the three outcomes distinctly. It MUST NOT report an
indeterminate check as valid, MUST NOT reject a schema solely because a check
was indeterminate, and MUST NOT act on an annotation as though an indeterminate
check had held.

A rule whose subject lies within the schema is always evaluable, and a check of
such a rule is never indeterminate. A rule whose subject is an external
definition is indeterminate for as long as that definition is unresolved.

Which definitions a processor holds is a deployment matter, so two conforming
processors MAY reach different outcomes for one schema. They MUST differ only in
that one returns indeterminate where the other returns valid or invalid. A
processor MUST NOT return valid where a processor holding the definition would
return invalid.

A profile, a deployment, or an agreement between parties MAY require that named
checks be evaluated rather than left indeterminate. This document requires it of
no check.

## Schema Conformance {#schema-conformance}

A conforming schema selects the versioned extension meta-schema URI. It MAY use
any subset of the annotations defined by this document, including none, and it
MUST NOT be rejected merely because an annotation or annotated property is
absent.

Every annotation that is present:

* MUST occur at an attachment point permitted by this document;
* MUST have the defined value shape and use an allowed `kind`, `semanticRole`,
  or `referenceRole` value;
* MUST NOT repeat, within one containing type, a `semanticRole` that
  {{semantic-role}} states identifies one position;
* MUST be compatible with the Core type of the annotated schema; and
* MUST satisfy the applicable rules of JSON Structure Units {{JSTRUCT-UNITS}}.

Validation MUST reject malformed annotations and invalid identifiers or values
within annotations, and those checks are never indeterminate. External
resolution, domain-of-validity, mapping-review, and transformation checks are
indeterminate while the definition they depend on is unresolved, and
{{check-outcomes}} states how a processor reports them.

## Processing Conformance {#processing-conformance}

A conforming processor MUST preserve declarations, externally resolved facts,
and inferences separately. It MUST preserve the differences among an
observation act, its result, an observable-property identity, a definition URI,
an identifiable temporal object, and a temporal-position
value.

A processor MUST NOT infer:

* any `semanticRole`, observed-property annotation, concept binding, derivation,
  statistic, or cadence from a name, label, description, type, unit, position,
  or sample;
* a `referenceRole`, or the member of a meta-type that a mapping property names,
  from a member name;
* graph structure, node identity, statements, or entailment from a concept
  binding, or a term of one vocabulary from a term of another;
* identity or semantic equivalence from labels, `closeMatch`, hierarchy,
  relatedness, or QuantityKind classification;
* a feature, procedure, or identity absent from the corresponding
  `semanticRole`, or a proximate feature from an ultimate feature or conversely;
* a temporal reference regime from a non-Core or ambiguous encoding;
* metric intervals from ordinal positions or an `untilNext` end from cadence;
* complete coverage from `interval` or `accumulation`;
* that absent quality means acceptable quality;
* a coordinate, vector-frame, or linear reference binding from names or samples;
* the direction, sense, or component order of a frame transformation, or the
  variance of a vector or tensor quantity, from member names, from the values
  themselves, or from the frames the transformation runs between;
* a color space, an illuminant, an observer, a transfer function, or an alpha
  mode from channel names, from the range the channel values fall in, or from
  the number of channels present;
* an audio channel layout, level reference, or encoding; a spectral band set or
  calibration; a code-list binding; or a measurement weighting, time weighting,
  or level reference, from names, samples, units, or the number of members
  present;
* that members sharing a name prefix, a unit, or an observed property are the
  components of one vector quantity; or
* permission to aggregate, convert, transform, reject outliers, or infer
  causality.

A processor that selects one temporal position as the event-time axis of a
record, for windowing, ordering, or watermarking, SHOULD select the member
annotated `phenomenonTime`, or, where the record bounds the period at both ends,
the member annotated `phenomenonTimeStart`. It SHOULD NOT select a member
annotated `resultTime`, `ingestionTime`, `scheduledTime`, or `actualTime` for
that purpose. Those roles state the handling of the record and not the time of
the phenomenon, and a window built on them reports the behaviour of the pipeline
rather than of the world.

Where a processor needs both axes and its execution model admits only one, the
phenomenon-time member is the recommended axis, and the operational position is
carried as an ordinary value. A processor that departs from this SHOULD record
the position it selected, so that a reader of the output is not left to infer
which axis produced it.

A record annotating no phenomenon-time role supplies no phenomenon-time axis. A
processor MUST NOT construct one from a member name, and MUST NOT read an
operational position as one. It MAY still window on an operational position,
which states when the record was handled.

A processor MAY ignore this extension. A processor claiming support MUST treat
unresolved identifiers, domains, mappings, or conversions
as indeterminate rather than compatible.

## Inheritance and Imports {#inheritance-and-imports}

An annotation on an inherited property or type remains part of the effective
schema. Core inheritance does not define a local override of an inherited
property. Cross-property rules MUST be checked against the effective inherited
type.

JSON Structure Import copies complete definitions, including annotations
{{JSTRUCT-IMPORT}}. Shadowing replaces the complete imported definition; it does
not merge individual annotations.

Member names stated by an annotation are resolved as {{annotation-model}}
requires: against the effective definition of the annotated type, and against
declared property names rather than serialized ones.

An annotation belongs to the definition it is written on, so annotations are
part of what a type means rather than of how one schema uses it. A schema that
needs different annotations for the same structure shadows the definition
and restates them, or defines a distinct type. This document defines no overlay
by which a schema attaches annotations to a definition it does not own.

Where a type would inherit the same keyword from more than one base, the derived
definition MUST state that keyword itself, and the stated value is the effective
one. A definition that leaves two inherited values of one keyword in force is
not conforming, and a processor MUST NOT select between them.

# Extension Meta-Schema {#extension-meta-schema}

The extension meta-schema will be published at:

`https://json-structure.org/meta/semantic-annotations/v0/#`

It offers one feature, `JSONStructureSemanticAnnotations`, whose add-ins contribute
the keywords defined here to the Core property, object, tuple, array, set, map,
and choice definitions. A schema activates this specification by selecting that
URI and naming the feature in `$uses`. The meta-schema enables JSON Structure
Units, Import, Conditional Composition, and Validation. The annotations carry no
profile or version member; the versioned meta-schema URI is the version
identifier.

The meta-schema validates the shape of each annotation defined here: the
presence and form of its members, the enumerations that {{annotation-model}}
states are closed, and the form required of a `reference` for the accompanying
`kind`. It does not express a rule
whose subject lies outside the annotated node. Such rules, including every rule
about a property that an annotation names and every rule about a definition that
a `reference` identifies, are checked against the effective schema rather than by
the meta-schema alone. No companion reference type or import is required.

# Security and Privacy Considerations {#security-considerations}

Incorrect or malicious catalog entries, labels, mappings,
feature identities, or procedure identities can cause results from different
subjects, acts, or concepts to be combined. Implementations MUST preserve
catalog-URI identity, MUST NOT infer equivalence from discovery labels, and MUST NOT treat an
unreviewed or non-exact mapping as approval. Catalog write access and mapping
review therefore require authentication, authorization, audit, and provenance.
Deprecation alternatives are migration advice, not automatic substitutions.

No annotation is checked against the data it describes. Validation confirms that
a named member exists, that a closed enumeration holds, and that components and
units agree in number and kind; it cannot confirm that a `reference` still
identifies the definition the values are actually expressed against. An
annotation is therefore a claim that can be true when written and false later
without anything failing: an instrument is recalibrated, a station is resurveyed
onto a new datum, a producer reorders channels or changes a rate, a code list is
superseded. The schema continues to validate and the annotation continues to
read as authoritative.

Stale annotation is for that reason more dangerous than absent annotation. The
prohibitions in {{processing-conformance}} guard the absent case, where a
processor is required to decline rather than guess; they do not guard the stale
case, where a processor holds an explicit statement, has no ground to doubt it,
and proceeds with a combination it would otherwise have refused. A schema author
MUST revise the annotations of a schema in the same change that alters what the
schema describes, and a consumer MUST NOT treat an annotation as evidence more
current than the schema revision carrying it.

The same property makes annotations a target. Modifying a schema changes what
data means without touching the data, without failing validation, and without
any signal to a consumer: a substituted CRS reference relocates every
coordinate, an `alphaMode` moved between `straight` and `premultiplied` alters
every composite, an altered `levelReference` shifts every level by an amount
large enough to matter and plausible enough to pass review. Schema distribution
therefore needs the integrity protection the data needs, and a change to an
annotation warrants the review a change to a type warrants.

Incorrect temporal roles, boundaries, reference systems, transformations, or
domains of validity can reorder positions or create false coverage. Cadence MUST
NOT synthesize a missing `untilNext` successor. Incorrect CRS, axis order, LRS,
measure origin, unit, or direction can place a feature incorrectly. Processors
MUST NOT perform temporal, coordinate, linear, or unit transformations without
validating authoritative definitions.

Catalog labels and mappings, procedure and feature identities, locations,
times, statuses, and quality can reveal sensitive operations or subjects. Hidden
labels are not an access-control mechanism. This specification grants no access and
does not replace minimization, privacy review, retention, or export controls.

Remote registries, schemas, vocabularies, procedures, mapping targets, and
reference systems are untrusted input. Implementations SHOULD use HTTPS where
available, bounded retrieval, caching with version awareness, allow-lists where
appropriate, cycle detection, and explicit trust decisions. Dereferencing can
disclose processor interest.

# IANA Considerations {#iana-considerations}

# Reference URIs (Informative) {#reference-uris}

The URIs below illustrate the `kind` values defined in this document. None of
these lists is exhaustive, and a publisher can supersede any definition.

## Vocabularies {#vocabulary-uris}

A `reference` identifies a term, not the namespace of the model that defines it;
{{concepts}} names the model behind each `kind`. Vocabularies that define terms
in those models and that are widely used with observation data include the
Semantic Sensor Network ontology {{SOSA-SSN}}, which publishes
`http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/` and `http://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/`, and the Provenance
Ontology {{PROV-O}}, which publishes `http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#`.

## Temporal Reference Systems {#temporal-reference-uris}

The URIs in this section resolve at the OGC definitions server.

Time-scale concepts, for `kind` `ogc-trs`:

* `http://www.opengis.net/def/trs/BIPM/0/UTC`, Coordinated Universal Time;
* `http://www.opengis.net/def/trs/BIPM/0/TAI`, International Atomic Time;
* `http://www.opengis.net/def/trs/IERS/0/UT1`, Universal Time UT1; and
* `http://www.opengis.net/def/trs/USNO/0/GPS`, GPS Time.

None of these constrains the type of the annotated value. Each names a time
scale and establishes no axis, unit, or encoding, so any of them can accompany
a Core temporal type, a string, a numeric epoch count, or a compound position.

Temporal coordinate reference systems, for `kind` `ogc-temporal-crs`. Each
establishes an origin and an axis, and the axis constrains the annotated type:

* `http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/GregorianDateTime`, a date and time in
  the Gregorian calendar. Its axis carries no unit, and it takes a Core
  `datetime`, `date`, or `time`, or a `string` in the same form.
* `http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/UnixTime`, seconds elapsed from
  1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. It takes an integer or number carrying UCUM `s`.
* `http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/AnsiDate`, days elapsed from
  1601-01-01T00:00:00Z. It takes an integer or number carrying UCUM `d`.
* `http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/JulianDate`, days elapsed from the
  Julian period origin. It takes a number carrying UCUM `d`, since its origin
  falls at noon and positions are ordinarily fractional.
* `http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/TruncatedJulianDate`, days elapsed
  from 1968-05-24T00:00:00Z. It takes a number carrying UCUM `d`.
* `http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/BeforePresentTime`, years counted
  backwards from 1950. It takes a number carrying UCUM `a`.
* `http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/ChronometricGeologicTime`, millions of
  years counted backwards from year zero. It takes a number carrying UCUM `Ma`.

None of the numeric definitions takes a string, and `GregorianDateTime` does
not take a number. The last two count backwards, so a larger value is an
earlier position and `sortOrder` is `backward`.

The register also serves a parameterized definition taking an origin and a
unit, which covers epoch counts for which no named definition exists. A count
of milliseconds from the Unix origin is identified by:

~~~
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/Temporal
  ?epoch=%221970-01-01T00:00:00Z%22&uom=%22ms%22
~~~

Parameter values are quoted, and the URI is one line. The constraint follows
the `uom` parameter: this URI takes an integer or number carrying UCUM `ms`.
A count of seconds from the same origin is a different definition, not the same
definition read at a different scale.

## Coordinate Reference Systems {#coordinate-reference-uris}

For `kind` `ogc-crs`:

* `http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84`, WGS 84 with axes longitude,
  latitude;
* `http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/0/CRS84h`, WGS 84 with axes longitude,
  latitude, ellipsoidal height;
* `http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326`, WGS 84 with axes latitude,
  longitude;
* `http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4979`, WGS 84 with axes latitude,
  longitude, ellipsoidal height.

Axis order differs among these definitions, and the definition establishes it.
The first two and the last two describe the same datum in opposite axis order.

For `kind` `epsg`, the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset serves its own records,
for example `https://apps.epsg.org/api/v1/CoordRefSystem/4326` {{EPSG}}. A
definition served at an OGC URI under an EPSG code, as in the list above, is
`ogc-crs` rather than `epsg`.

## Vector Reference Frames {#vector-reference-uris}

No register of vector reference frames corresponds to the temporal and
coordinate registers. A registered coordinate reference system whose axes are
directions may be cited with `ogc-crs` or `epsg`, and the URIs listed in
{{coordinate-reference-uris}} apply unchanged. Most frames in which vector
quantities are reported are not registered at all.

Some communities publish a closed list of frame *names* without serving a URI
per frame. The SPASE data model {{SPASE}} is the case in point: its
`CoordinateSystemName` enumeration fixes tokens such as `GSE`, `GSM`, `GEI`,
`SM`, `RTN`, `HEE`, `MFA`, and `SensorCoordinates`, and defines what each one
means, but the register itself carries no per-token reference URI. A token from
such a list is not a `reference` value. Where the community that publishes the
list also serves a resolvable definition, that URI is the `reference` and the
token is not; where it does not, the frame is written as a `tuple` meta-type in
the schema document and cited with `kind` `type`, as in
{{vector-reference-frames}}.

## Linear Reference Systems {#linear-reference-uris}

No register of linear reference systems corresponds to the temporal and
coordinate registers. ISO 19148 {{ISO19148}} specifies the conceptual schema,
in which a location is a measurement along a linear element and optionally an
offset from it, so that overlapping attributes can be carried against one
geometry without fragmenting it. It defines no identifiers for individual
systems. A linear reference system is therefore published by the authority that
maintains the network, which is why `lrs-network` is the value defined here for
a published system, and why a system published in another form is identified by
a value naming the model that publishes it. A system that no authority publishes
is defined as a meta-type in the schema and cited with `type`.

In the United States, the FHWA ARNOLD directive {{FHWA-ARNOLD}} requires each
state department of transportation to maintain one linear reference system
covering all public roads, modelled as the HPMS Field Manual prescribes
{{FHWA-HPMS}}: routes carrying measure values on their vertices, with
attributes held in event tables that cite a route and a measure rather than
segmenting the underlying geometry. A service published under that directive is
an `lrs-network`, and its layer and metadata resources establish the linear
elements and the measure. The Washington state route network used in
{{linear-reference-systems}} is served at
`https://data.wsdot.wa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Shared/LRSData/FeatureServer/9`
{{WSDOT-LRS}}.

## Code Lists {#code-list-uris}

A `reference` identifies one specific code list, and `kind` classifies the
register model that list belongs to ({{coded-values}}). The registers fall into
two tiers by how a `reference` behaves.

Some publish a resolvable URI for the list, or for each entry, so that a
`reference` both identifies and dereferences:

* `wmo-codes`: a register in the WMO Codes Registry, such as
  `http://codes.wmo.int/bufr4/codeflag/0-20-003`, the present-weather register,
  whose entries are served beneath it {{WMO-CODES}}.
* `iana`: a registry served under `https://www.iana.org/assignments/`, such as
  `https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml` for media
  types, or `https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry` for the
  BCP 47 language subtags {{IANA-PROTOCOLS}} {{IANA-LANGTAGS}}.
* `snomed-ct`: an edition under the SNOMED CT URI scheme, `http://snomed.info/sct`
  for the International Edition, with a module or version appended for a specific
  release {{SNOMED-CT}}.
* `loinc`: the LOINC code system, `http://loinc.org` {{LOINC}}.
* `icd`: a WHO linearization, `http://id.who.int/icd/release/11/mms` for the
  ICD-11 mortality and morbidity statistics {{WHO-ICD}}.

The rest publish their lists in standards or directories that mint no per-list
machine URI. A `reference` to one identifies more often than it resolves, and
names the standard's identifier or landing page:

* `iso`: an ISO code table, named by its catalogue page such as
  `https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html`, or by a standard URN such as
  `urn:iso:std:iso:3166:-1` {{ISO3166}} {{ISO4217}} {{ISO639}}.
* `unlocode`:
  `https://unece.org/trade/cefact/unlocode-code-list-country-and-territory`
  {{UNLOCODE}}.
* `icao`: the location indicators of Doc 7910,
  `https://store.icao.int/en/location-indicators-doc-7910`, or the aircraft type
  designators of Doc 8643,
  `https://www.icao.int/operational-safety/doc-8643-aircraft-type-designators`
  {{ICAO7910}} {{ICAO8643}}.
* `iata`: `https://www.iata.org/en/publications/directories/code-search/`
  {{IATA-CODES}}.
* `atc`: `https://atcddd.fhi.no/atc_ddd_index/` {{WHO-ATC}}.
* `unspsc`: `https://www.ungm.org/Public/UNSPSC` {{UNSPSC}}.

A processor is not required to dereference a `reference` of either tier, and an
unresolved `reference` is indeterminate rather than incorrect. Under `kind`
`type` the list is a meta-type in the schema and `reference` is the type
reference `{ "$ref": <JSON Pointer> }`, not a URI.
