"""Supervised, controlled, blinded evaluation of the semantic annotations.

This replaces the self-reported comprehension probe recorded in `EVALUATION.md`.
That probe asked a model to read a schema and rate its own confidence, which
questions 57 to 59 of `Q-A.md` object to on four grounds: the score was the
subject's own opinion, 40 of 43 samples had no control, nothing was blinded, and
one model is one data point. Each objection is answered by a part of this
harness.

  self-report   The subject is never asked how confident it is. A separate
                supervisor grades its transcript against a rubric derived
                mechanically from the annotations (`rubric.py`), claim by claim,
                with a verbatim quote required for every non-null verdict.

  no control    Every sample is run twice: once against the annotated schema and
                once against a control schema with the semantic layer stripped
                out. The control is generated at run time by the same code that
                generates the committed unannotated companions, so it cannot
                drift and no sample is exempt.

  no blinding   The supervisor sees the two transcripts in randomised order as A
                and B, is not told which arm is which, and is not given either
                schema. It is asked afterwards whether it could tell them apart,
                and that answer is reported as a measure of how well the
                blinding held rather than quietly dropped.

  one model     `--subject-model` may be repeated. The subject and the supervisor
                are separate clients, and the harness warns when they are the
                same model, because a model grading itself is not supervision.

What this harness still cannot do is settle whether an analysis is any good for
its domain. Those claims are emitted in the `expert` tier, are shown to a human,
and are excluded from every score. A language model is not a domain expert and
this harness does not let one pretend to be.
